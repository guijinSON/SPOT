However, in figure c, we displayed all applied treatments at 72 hours (not just tacrolimus). The critique alerted us that the figure contained unnecessarily redundant elements and therefore we will request a correction from the journal, especially because the red squere labelled error is real image error occurred the figure editing, the image cropping. Specifically, the 21-day and 72-hour treatment samples were run in parallel, and during image cropping, we mistakenly inserted the same cut blot section from the submitted whole image (Fig - WB No. 56) into the Rictor image in figures a and b.\n\nRegarding the concerns raised about Raptor expression: The Rictor and Raptor staining did not reveal significant or notable differences on a wide variety of blots, so no conclusions were drawn about these in the main text and in the Results or Discussion sections. The Raptor analysis does not provide any substantial additional information for the paper, and it was included in Figure solely for visualization purposes. However, as no conclusions were drawn from these, it would have been best to omit them from the figure.\nTo rectify these issues and eliminate the discussed redundancy, we are preparing a revised and simplified figure that focuses on the key differences observed and discussed in the main text after tacrolimus treatment.

1. Unexpected similarity between western blots in Figure 3:
   - The red rectangles highlight similar regions that should represent different time points.
   - Possible redundancy due to repeating data from 72-hour experiments.

2. Mistaken duplication of blot images:
   - Figure 3 parts a and c contain mistakenly repeated data.
   - Repetition occurred due to figure editing errors, specifically in image cropping.

3. Specific errors in blot labeling:
   - The cut blot section was mistakenly inserted into the Rictor image in figures a and b due to errors during image cropping.

4. Misleading presentation of Raptor results:
   - Raptor expression did not show notable differences and thus its inclusion in the figure was unnecessary.
   - Raptor analysis did not contribute to the paper’s conclusions and should have been omitted. 

5. Request for correction:
   - Authors plan to revise and simplify the figure to remove redundant elements.
   - Correction limited to the figure; no changes to the main text, results, or conclusions.

1. **Overlapping Panels in Figure 10**: There are multiple overlapping panels between the control and the treated groups in Figure 10, raising questions about the integrity and reliability of the presented data.

2. **Animal Consistency Issues**: There is inconsistency regarding the animal model used in the study:
   - The abstract mentions histopathological assessment on rabbits.
   - The methods section refers to experimentation on mice.
   - Figure 9’s legend describes analysis involving mice.
   - Figure 10’s legend also mentions mice as the subjects.
   - The results and conclusion sections discuss findings related to rabbits, contradicting the methods and figure legends.

3. **Correction Regarding Animal Use**: The article was corrected post-publication to address errors concerning animal identification:
   - ""Mice"" should be replaced with ""rabbits"" in three specific sentences that were incorrectly referring to the animal subjects.
   - This correction was formally acknowledged by the authors with an apology for any inconvenience caused.

Overall, the primary errors relate to overlapping panels in Figure 10 and inconsistent animal identification throughout the paper, which have implications for interpreting the study's results and conclusions.

       dtype=object), 'text': '#1\nWe appreciate the commentator\'s concern and engagement with our study. The following are our answers to the three questions mentioned by PUBPEER. The following contents were replied by Chenglin Chu, Lei Yang, and Yumeng Dong on behalf of all the authors.\nDetails of related papers are as follows:\nPaper 1: L. Yang, Y.B. Zhao, Y.M. Dong, J.Y. Yang, S.Y. Wang, C. Wang, J. Bai, F. Xue, P.K. Chu, C.L. Chu*, Hybrid chondroitin sulfate-tailored phosphate coatings for improved corrosion and wear resistance of WE43 Mg alloy, Surf. Coat. Technol. 503 (2025) 132012. (hereinafter referred to as ""Paper 1"")\nPaper 2: Y. Dong, Y. Zhao, L. Yang, J. Yang, J. Dai, C. Wang, J. Bai, F. Xue, P.K. Chu, C. Chu*, Phosphate coatings on WE43 Mg alloy with improved corrosion resistance and bonding strength and effects of hydrothermal temperature, Mater. Today Commun. 44 (2025), 112034. (hereinafter referred to as ""Paper 2"")\nQuestion 1: Why does the same yellow electrochemical Tafel curve (corresponding to the hydrothermal synthesis of magnesium potassium phosphate (MKP) coating at 120 ℃ for 4 hours) appear in two papers, namely Fig. 6 of Paper 2 and Fig. 5 of Paper 1? The problem is that the magnesium (Mg) alloy substrate was pretreated with sodium hydroxide lye for 2 hours before the synthesis of MKP coating in Paper 2; However, the pretreatment of Mg alloy substrate in Paper 1 is sodium hydroxide alkali pretreatment for half an hour. These two samples should be different and not the same yellow electrochemical Tafel curve.\nOur reply:\nThis problem exists because the first author of Paper 1 carelessly applied the data jointly measured by the first authors of two papers in the early stage (that is, the yellow electrochemical data in Fig. 6 in Paper 2) when sorting out the electrochemical curves. This oversight does not affect the novelty and conclusion of Paper 1.\nThe first authors of the two papers are doctoral students of the same research group. During the research work of the two papers, there was both cooperation and specific division of labor, so the first authors of the two papers were the co-authors of the other paper. The two sides jointly verified the preliminary feasibility preparation of MKP coating on WE43 Mg alloy by hydrothermal method, that is, the Mg alloy substrate was pretreated with sodium hydroxide for 2 hours, and then the uniform MKP coating was prepared by hydrothermal method at 120 ℃ for 4 hours, and its electrochemical performance data were tested.\nOn this basis, the first author of Paper 2 continues to systematically study the preparation and properties of MKP inorganic coating prepared by hydrothermal method on WE43, especially the influence of hydrothermal temperature (90, 120, 150 and 180 ℃, respectively). The comparative study sample is WE43 Mg alloy substrate.\nIn Paper 1, the first author focuses on the preparation of ""MKP/CSA hybrid coating"" on WE43 by hydrothermal method, focusing on the influence of CSA on the hybrid coating. The comparative samples include MKP inorganic coating synthesized by hydrothermal method at 120 ℃ for 4 hours. The first author of Paper 1 shortened the pretreatment time of Mg alloy substrate with sodium hydroxide lye to half an hour during the research.\nOn March 10, 2025, after submitting the proofreading of Paper 1, the first author of Paper 1 checked the data again and found that, due to his negligence and carelessness, Fig. 5 in Paper 1 accidentally used the electrochemical data of MKP coating measured in cooperation with the first author of Paper 2 earlier, that is, yellow electrochemical data curve of Fig. 6 in Paper 2 (both corresponding to hydrothermal synthesis of MKP coating at 120 ℃ for 4 hours).\nAt present, the data of the two papers have been carefully checked, and no other data problems have been found. We have contacted the editorial department of Surf. Coat. Technol., filled in a correction statement according to the advice of the journal editor, and are waiting for the related department to review and publish Corrigendum.\nQuestion 2: Why are different electrochemical data fitted about the electrochemical curve of the same MKP coating?\nOur reply:\nThe first authors of the two papers each gave their own methods and data for independent processing, as follows.\n(1) The detailed fitting method and data of Fig. 5 in Paper 1 are as follows:\nDifferent fitting data ranges and different subjective judgments in the fitting process may lead to subtle differences in the data obtained by Tafel extrapolation, which is normal and reasonable. My detailed derivation process is as follows:\nIn Paper 1, Tafel extrapolation method is used to reflect the self-corrosion potential (Ecorr, V/SCE) and corrosion current density (icorr, A/cm2), and the corrosion resistance can be judged. The specific fitting process is as follows:\nBy Versastudio software, the tangents of cathodic polarization curve and anodic polarization curve are made in the area near the open circuit potential (as shown in the gray box ① in Fig. 1), and the related results (Ecorr and icorr) are shown in the purple box ②.\n\nFig. 1. Derivation process of MKP coating in Paper 1.\nThe results are as follows:\nEcorr: -1.692 V/SCE;\nicorr: 9.458 × 10-6 A/cm2\nIn Paper 1, the relevant data are:\n\nFig. 2. MKP coating data in Paper 1.\nBy comparing the above data, it is not difficult to find that there is almost no difference between the data obtained in this derivation and the data in Paper 1. The data in Paper 1 is the real data independently derived and fitted by the first author, and can provide original data to prove it. There is no falsification or tampering of data.\n(2) Detailed fitting method and data of Paper 2:\nThe fitting process of the potentiodynamic polarization curve of MKP120 sample in Paper 2 are as follows:\n\nFig. 3. Data and fitting of the potentiodynamic polarization curve of MKP120.\nTake the strong polarization region of the potentiodynamic polarization curve for fitting, and the fitting interval is shown in the red box line above. The Tafel extrapolation method of cathode fitting is used in the actual fitting, that is, only the lower half of the potentiodynamic polarization curve (cathode polarization region) is concerned.\nBy Versastudio software, the corrosion potential (Ecorr) and corrosion current density (icorr) obtained by fitting are (marked by the green box in the figure):\nEcorr  : -1.691 V/SCE\nicorr : 8.436 μA⋅cm−2\nIn Paper 2, the relevant data are:\n\nFig. 4. Electrochemical fitting results provided in Paper 2.\nBy comparing the above data, it is not difficult to find that there is almost no difference between the data obtained in this derivation and the data in Paper 2. The data in Paper 2 is the real data independently derived and fitted by the first author, and can provide original data to prove it. There is no falsification or tampering of data.\nIn addition, why the Rct values and EIS fitting results in the two papers are different is closely related to the fact that the two authors independently adopt different equivalent circuit models. The equivalent circuit model simplifies the reaction system differently, so the data obtained are different.\nQuestion 3: Why does the difference of the fitted WE43 substrate data exist?\nOur reply:\n(1) Description of detailed fitting methods and data of Paper 1:\nThe electrochemical data of WE43 Mg alloy substrate are different in different papers for obvious reasons: the electrochemical curve is highly sensitive to the surface roughness, pretreatment state, machining residual stress and the position of the second phase of Mg alloy, and the above parameters of WE43 Mg alloy substrate in different papers cannot be completely consistent, so it is normal and reasonable that the electrochemical data of WE43 Mg alloy substrate are different in different papers. The different electrochemical data of WE43 alloy in the following related references can also be proved.\n\nFig. 5. Related references.\nSimilarly, the Ecorr and icorr data of WE43 substrate in Paper 1 are derived by Tafel extrapolation method, as shown in Fig. 6.\n\nFig. 6. Derivation process of WE43 substrate data in Paper 1.\nThe results are as follows:\nEcorr: -1.743 V/SCE;\nicorr: 2.487 × 10-5 A/cm2\nIn Paper 1, the relevant data are:\n\nFig. 7. WE43 substrate data in Paper 1.\nBy comparing the above data, it is not difficult to find that there is almost no difference between the data obtained in this derivation and the data in Paper 1. The data in Paper 1 is the real data independently derived and fitted by the first author and can provide original data to prove it. There is no falsification or tampering of data.\n(2) Description of detailed fitting methods and data in Paper 2:\n\nFig. 8. Data and fitting of potentiodynamic polarization curve of WE43 in Paper 2.\nThe fitting method is the same as above, and the selected fitting interval is marked by a red frame. The specific data results are shown in the green frame:\nEcorr  : -1.5 V\nicorr : 41.486 μA⋅cm− 2\nIn Paper 2, the relevant data are:\n\nFig. 9. Electrochemical fitting results provided in Paper 2.\nBy comparing the above data, it is not difficult to find that there is almost no difference between the data obtained in this derivation and the data in Paper 2. The data in Paper 2 is the real data independently derived and fitted by the first author and can provide original data to prove it. There is no falsification or tampering of data.\nTo sum up, for the first question:** the same yellow electrochemical Tafel curve (corresponding to the hydrothermal synthesis of MKP coating at 120 ℃ for 4 hours) appeared in two papers** because the same yellow electrochemical curve data was inadvertently used in Fig. 5 of Paper 1 and Fig. 6 of Paper 2. We have contacted the editorial department of Surf. Coat. Technol, filled in a correction statement according to the advice of the journal editor of the paper, and are waiting for the editorial department to review and publish Corrigendum.

# Errors Identified

1. **Duplicate Electrochemical Tafel Curve:**
    - The same yellow electrochemical Tafel curve, corresponding to the hydrothermal synthesis of an MKP coating at 120 ℃ for 4 hours, appeared in both Fig. 6 of Paper 2 and Fig. 5 of Paper 1.
    - This occurred due to an oversight by the first author of Paper 1, who carelessly used jointly measured data from the first authors of both papers.
    
2. **Inconsistencies in Electrochemical Data Fittings:**
    - Different electrochemical data are fitted despite being based on the same curves, resulting in varied values of corrosion current density and wildly different Rct values from EIS analysis.
    - The discrepancies were due to different fitting methodologies, data ranges, and subjective judgments in the Tafel extrapolation method used by the authors of the two papers.
    - Different equivalent circuit models adopted by the authors led to varied Rct values in the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) results.

3. **Variability in Substrate Electrochemical Data:**
    - Electrochemical data of the WE43 substrate significantly varied between the two papers, displaying differences in the corrosion potential (Ecorr) and corrosion current density (icorr).
    - Differences were attributed to variations in surface properties such as surface roughness, pretreatment states, machining residual stress, and positions of the Mg alloy's second phase, among others.

The authors have contacted the editors of the journal to address the error in data duplication and have filled a correction statement. They assert that the identified issues do not affect the novelty and conclusions of the papers.

       dtype=object), 'text': '#1\nWe appreciate the commentator\'s concern and engagement with our study. The following are our answers to the three questions mentioned by PUBPEER. The following contents were replied by Chenglin Chu, Lei Yang, and Yumeng Dong on behalf of all the authors.\nDetails of related papers are as follows:\nPaper 1: L. Yang, Y.B. Zhao, Y.M. Dong, J.Y. Yang, S.Y. Wang, C. Wang, J. Bai, F. Xue, P.K. Chu, C.L. Chu*, Hybrid chondroitin sulfate-tailored phosphate coatings for improved corrosion and wear resistance of WE43 Mg alloy, Surf. Coat. Technol. 503 (2025) 132012. (hereinafter referred to as ""Paper 1"")\nPaper 2: Y. Dong, Y. Zhao, L. Yang, J. Yang, J. Dai, C. Wang, J. Bai, F. Xue, P.K. Chu, C. Chu*, Phosphate coatings on WE43 Mg alloy with improved corrosion resistance and bonding strength and effects of hydrothermal temperature, Mater. Today Commun. 44 (2025), 112034. (hereinafter referred to as ""Paper 2"")\nQuestion 1: Why does the same yellow electrochemical Tafel curve (corresponding to the hydrothermal synthesis of magnesium potassium phosphate (MKP) coating at 120 ℃ for 4 hours) appear in two papers, namely Fig. 6 of Paper 2 and Fig. 5 of Paper 1? The problem is that the magnesium (Mg) alloy substrate was pretreated with sodium hydroxide lye for 2 hours before the synthesis of MKP coating in Paper 2; However, the pretreatment of Mg alloy substrate in Paper 1 is sodium hydroxide alkali pretreatment for half an hour. These two samples should be different and not the same yellow electrochemical Tafel curve.\nOur reply:\nThis problem exists because the first author of Paper 1 carelessly applied the data jointly measured by the first authors of two papers in the early stage (that is, the yellow electrochemical data in Fig. 6 in Paper 2) when sorting out the electrochemical curves. This oversight does not affect the novelty and conclusion of Paper 1.\nThe first authors of the two papers are doctoral students of the same research group. During the research work of the two papers, there was both cooperation and specific division of labor, so the first authors of the two papers were the co-authors of the other paper. The two sides jointly verified the preliminary feasibility preparation of MKP coating on WE43 Mg alloy by hydrothermal method, that is, the Mg alloy substrate was pretreated with sodium hydroxide for 2 hours, and then the uniform MKP coating was prepared by hydrothermal method at 120 ℃ for 4 hours, and its electrochemical performance data were tested.\nOn this basis, the first author of Paper 2 continues to systematically study the preparation and properties of MKP inorganic coating prepared by hydrothermal method on WE43, especially the influence of hydrothermal temperature (90, 120, 150 and 180 ℃, respectively). The comparative study sample is WE43 Mg alloy substrate.\nIn Paper 1, the first author focuses on the preparation of ""MKP/CSA hybrid coating"" on WE43 by hydrothermal method, focusing on the influence of CSA on the hybrid coating. The comparative samples include MKP inorganic coating synthesized by hydrothermal method at 120 ℃ for 4 hours. The first author of Paper 1 shortened the pretreatment time of Mg alloy substrate with sodium hydroxide lye to half an hour during the research.\nOn March 10, 2025, after submitting the proofreading of Paper 1, the first author of Paper 1 checked the data again and found that, due to his negligence and carelessness, Fig. 5 in Paper 1 accidentally used the electrochemical data of MKP coating measured in cooperation with the first author of Paper 2 earlier, that is, yellow electrochemical data curve of Fig. 6 in Paper 2 (both corresponding to hydrothermal synthesis of MKP coating at 120 ℃ for 4 hours).\nAt present, the data of the two papers have been carefully checked, and no other data problems have been found. We have contacted the editorial department of Surf. Coat. Technol., filled in a correction statement according to the advice of the journal editor, and are waiting for the related department to review and publish Corrigendum.\nQuestion 2: Why are different electrochemical data fitted about the electrochemical curve of the same MKP coating?\nOur reply:\nThe first authors of the two papers each gave their own methods and data for independent processing, as follows.\n(1) The detailed fitting method and data of Fig. 5 in Paper 1 are as follows:\nDifferent fitting data ranges and different subjective judgments in the fitting process may lead to subtle differences in the data obtained by Tafel extrapolation, which is normal and reasonable. My detailed derivation process is as follows:\nIn Paper 1, Tafel extrapolation method is used to reflect the self-corrosion potential (Ecorr, V/SCE) and corrosion current density (icorr, A/cm2), and the corrosion resistance can be judged. The specific fitting process is as follows:\nBy Versastudio software, the tangents of cathodic polarization curve and anodic polarization curve are made in the area near the open circuit potential (as shown in the gray box ① in Fig. 1), and the related results (Ecorr and icorr) are shown in the purple box ②.\n\nFig. 1. Derivation process of MKP coating in Paper 1.\nThe results are as follows:\nEcorr: -1.692 V/SCE;\nicorr: 9.458 × 10-6 A/cm2\nIn Paper 1, the relevant data are:\n\nFig. 2. MKP coating data in Paper 1.\nBy comparing the above data, it is not difficult to find that there is almost no difference between the data obtained in this derivation and the data in Paper 1. The data in Paper 1 is the real data independently derived and fitted by the first author, and can provide original data to prove it. There is no falsification or tampering of data.\n(2) Detailed fitting method and data of Paper 2:\nThe fitting process of the potentiodynamic polarization curve of MKP120 sample in Paper 2 are as follows:\n\nFig. 3. Data and fitting of the potentiodynamic polarization curve of MKP120.\nTake the strong polarization region of the potentiodynamic polarization curve for fitting, and the fitting interval is shown in the red box line above. The Tafel extrapolation method of cathode fitting is used in the actual fitting, that is, only the lower half of the potentiodynamic polarization curve (cathode polarization region) is concerned.\nBy Versastudio software, the corrosion potential (Ecorr) and corrosion current density (icorr) obtained by fitting are (marked by the green box in the figure):\nEcorr  : -1.691 V/SCE\nicorr : 8.436 μA⋅cm−2\nIn Paper 2, the relevant data are:\n\nFig. 4. Electrochemical fitting results provided in Paper 2.\nBy comparing the above data, it is not difficult to find that there is almost no difference between the data obtained in this derivation and the data in Paper 2. The data in Paper 2 is the real data independently derived and fitted by the first author, and can provide original data to prove it. There is no falsification or tampering of data.\nIn addition, why the Rct values and EIS fitting results in the two papers are different is closely related to the fact that the two authors independently adopt different equivalent circuit models. The equivalent circuit model simplifies the reaction system differently, so the data obtained are different.\nQuestion 3: Why does the difference of the fitted WE43 substrate data exist?\nOur reply:\n(1) Description of detailed fitting methods and data of Paper 1:\nThe electrochemical data of WE43 Mg alloy substrate are different in different papers for obvious reasons: the electrochemical curve is highly sensitive to the surface roughness, pretreatment state, machining residual stress and the position of the second phase of Mg alloy, and the above parameters of WE43 Mg alloy substrate in different papers cannot be completely consistent, so it is normal and reasonable that the electrochemical data of WE43 Mg alloy substrate are different in different papers. The different electrochemical data of WE43 alloy in the following related references can also be proved.\n\nFig. 5. Related references.\nSimilarly, the Ecorr and icorr data of WE43 substrate in Paper 1 are derived by Tafel extrapolation method, as shown in Fig. 6.\n\nFig. 6. Derivation process of WE43 substrate data in Paper 1.\nThe results are as follows:\nEcorr: -1.743 V/SCE;\nicorr: 2.487 × 10-5 A/cm2\nIn Paper 1, the relevant data are:\n\nFig. 7. WE43 substrate data in Paper 1.\nBy comparing the above data, it is not difficult to find that there is almost no difference between the data obtained in this derivation and the data in Paper 1. The data in Paper 1 is the real data independently derived and fitted by the first author and can provide original data to prove it. There is no falsification or tampering of data.\n(2) Description of detailed fitting methods and data in Paper 2:\n\nFig. 8. Data and fitting of potentiodynamic polarization curve of WE43 in Paper 2.\nThe fitting method is the same as above, and the selected fitting interval is marked by a red frame. The specific data results are shown in the green frame:\nEcorr  : -1.5 V\nicorr : 41.486 μA⋅cm− 2\nIn Paper 2, the relevant data are:\n\nFig. 9. Electrochemical fitting results provided in Paper 2.\nBy comparing the above data, it is not difficult to find that there is almost no difference between the data obtained in this derivation and the data in Paper 2. The data in Paper 2 is the real data independently derived and fitted by the first author and can provide original data to prove it. There is no falsification or tampering of data.\nTo sum up, for the first question: the same yellow electrochemical Tafel curve (corresponding to the hydrothermal synthesis of MKP coating at 120 ℃ for 4 hours) appeared in two papers because the same yellow electrochemical curve data was inadvertently used in Fig. 5 of Paper 1 and Fig. 6 of Paper 2. We have contacted the editorial department of Surf. Coat. Technol, filled in a correction statement according to the advice of the journal editor of the paper, and are waiting for the editorial department to review and publish Corrigendum. About question 2 and 3, we have given the detailed fitting methods and data completed by the first authors of the two papers, respectively. Comparing the data in the papers, it is not difficult to find that there is almost no difference between the derived data and those given in the two papers. These are all real data derived and fitted by the first authors themselves, and can provide original data as evidence, and there is no any behavior such as data fraud and tampering.\nThe novelty and conclusion of Paper 1 are not affected, and we apologize for the inconvenience caused by these problems.\nPlease contact us for any additional questions or clarifications regarding this email: clchu@seu.edu.cn'}]",pubpeer,"```markdown
# Summary of Errors

1. **Duplication of Electrochemical Data:**
   - The potentiodynamic polarization test for sample MKP in figure 5a matches the curve for sample MKP-120 from a different publication, despite differences in preparation conditions (etching time, temperature, electrolyte composition, pH). This duplication was due to the first author of Paper 1 mistakenly using data jointly measured by the first authors of two papers.

2. **Different Corrosion Values Despite Overlapping Curves:**
   - The authors report significantly different values for corrosion current density and Rct from EIS analysis for the same samples (MKP and MKP-120) despite the overlapping polarization curves.

3. **Varying Data for Substrate WE43:**
   - There is inconsistency in the electrochemical properties of the substrate WE43 across the papers, which the authors attribute to differences in surface roughness, pretreatment state, machining residual stress, and the position of the second phase of the Mg alloy.

4. **Inconsistent Electrochemical Fitting Methods:**
   - Different fitting methods were used in the papers, resulting in variations in the reported data values (e.g., Ecorr, icorr, Rct values). This was due to each first author conducting independent data processing with differing subjective judgments and equivalent circuit models.

5. **Inappropriate Use of Similar Electrochemical Curves:**
   - The same yellow electrochemical Tafel curve data was used in both Paper 1 and Paper 2. The authors acknowledge the error and have submitted a correction statement to rectify this mistake.

6. **Errors Considered Oversight Rather Than Fraud:**
   - The authors consider these issues as oversights due to collaboration and data sharing rather than intentional data falsification or tampering.

 {'images': array([], dtype=object), 'text': '#4\nThe concerns related to lipid interference were addressed in the paper.  Notably, this is an incorrect comparison of wet weight versus dry weight.  The brain is about 17% lipid by wet weight (and 73% water).  The kidney is around 5% lipid by wet weight.  A good reference comparing these in rodents is here (https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijac/2020/8819437), which shows the brain of rodents is only ~1.7-2.0 times the amount of phospholipid found in kidney.  The ratio is higher in humans because of the greater levels of white matter, but only about 3-4x, not 10. Neither organ contains significant adipose, so “fat” is a misleading term, as both organs have ample phospholipids in all membranes, vesicles, and as signaling molecules.\nThe referenced paper was based on the analysis of blood, not solid organs, and even so concluded that “Py-GC-MS may currently be suitable to detect PP, PMMA, PS, Nylon-6 or Nylon-66 in blood matrices, but only at the upper end of concentrations that might be biologically feasible if interferences and background contamination are reduced/removed”.  This paper, which notably was published 2 months after our paper was accepted, is an exceptional roadmap for how to assess polymers in biological matrices.  We will certainly adopt many of their assessments and confirmation methods going forward.\nFor the remaining points, we do not completely disagree – there is a tremendous need to advance the technological limits to address nanoparticulate plastics.  We presented our data transparently and the reviewers felt that the confluence of approaches provided insights of value.  Additionally, we are not even sure what we are looking for at this stage of the science.  Aged, degraded nanoplastics likely have very different characteristics – an organic corona, increased crystallinity, shorter polymer lengths, and increased content of oxygen, biologically-relevant ions like calcium and potassium, and other environmental contaminants (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154035).

1. **Duplicated Micrographs and Scale Bar Discrepancies**: Several micrographs in the supplementary section have been duplicated. In Extended Data Figure 3, identical micrographs show different size bars. Additionally, the higher resolution image (marked in orange) is not seen in the lower resolution image, indicating inconsistencies in the image presentation.

2. **Unrealistically Low Standard Deviations in Table S12**: Table S12 reports unrealistically low standard deviations for microplastic particle counts among aliquots, which suggests an unattainable underdispersion.

3. **Errors in Analytical Methods for Plastics**:
    - Failing to detect higher molecular weight ions for polyethylene (PE) in Py-GC-MS analysis indicates a false positive.
    - Using FTIR with low threshold matches increases the risk of false positives and does not effectively detect particles smaller than 10 µm, leading to potential misidentification of nanoplastics.
    - Employing microscopy without chemical confirmation of plastic particles presents misleading results.

4. **Incorrect Data Presentation in Table S12**: The table presented a sum of all fragments, fibers, and particles in 3 visual fields and should not have included error calculations.

5. **Concerns About Lipid Interference**: The lipid interference issue was oversimplified as a comparison of wet weight versus dry weight, and not adequately addressed concerning the detection of plastics in biological matrices. The comparison was incorrect, as the referenced paper provided was based on blood analysis and was not applicable to solid organs. The commentary highlighted the need for improved techniques to address nanoparticulate plastics in complex organic matrices.

6. **Clerical Errors in Image Assembly**: The images from ATR-FTIR in the supplemental section were assembled without sufficient attention to detail, resulting in errors that the authors acknowledged as clerical mistakes not affecting the manuscript's conclusions.

 {'images': array([], dtype=object), 'text': 'Thank you for your valuable comment on our published article, particularly regarding the citation of Ref. [35] and your observation that ""just FMO theory is not mentioned"" (as noted in the abstract of Ref. [35]). We appreciate your careful reading of the reference and acknowledge that the term ""Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) Theory"" is not explicitly stated in the abstract. However, we respectfully submit that the foundational concepts of FMO theory are inherently embedded in the computational approaches and interpretations presented in that work. Specifically:\nThe abstract of Ref. [35] clearly states that computational investigations were performed using quantum chemical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). As is widely recognized, DFT is a fundamental tool for obtaining molecular orbital parameters, particularly the energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which are central to FMO theory.\nWhile the descriptors mentioned in Ref. [35]—such as QTAIM, ELF, and LOL—do not directly represent HOMO/LUMO energies, they are derived from DFT and provide complementary insights into electronic structure and reactivity. These descriptors are used to explore charge density distributions and adsorption behavior, aligning with the conceptual framework of FMO theory in understanding how frontier orbitals influence molecular interactions.\nThe study employs these computational tools to investigate how the electronic properties of dye molecules affect their adsorption onto activated carbon (AC) surfaces. This approach reflects the core idea of FMO theory: that molecular reactivity and interaction tendencies can be predicted by analyzing frontier orbitals and electron density distributions.\nTherefore, although the term “FMO theory” is not explicitly mentioned in the abstract, the theoretical framework and interpretations in Ref. [35] are consistent with its principles. Our decision to cite this reference was based on its illustrative use of DFT-derived electronic descriptors to rationalize molecular interactions, which are highly relevant to the context of our study.\nWe hope this clarification addresses your concern and reinforces the relevance of Ref. [35] to our work. We are sincerely grateful for your thoughtful critique and engagement with our research.\nAdditionally, we appreciate your observations regarding the relevance of Refs. [37], [38], [39], and [40] to our discussion of global electronegativity (χ), electrophilicity index (ω), Mulliken atomic charges, and adsorption behavior, particularly in the context of electron-donating and -accepting properties.\nWe respectfully maintain the inclusion of these references and would like to further clarify their role in our discussion. While these studies involve different substrates and sorbates, their relevance lies in the shared conceptual and methodological foundation that underpins our work. Our primary aim in citing these references was to support the theoretical interpretation and application of quantum chemical descriptors—particularly χ and ω—along with Mulliken atomic charges, to evaluate electron transfer tendencies and molecular reactivity in adsorption-related phenomena.\nIt is well established in the computational chemistry literature that global reactivity descriptors such as electronegativity (χ) and electrophilicity index (ω) are universal indicators of a molecule’s ability to donate or accept electrons, independent of the specific chemical system. The cited references exemplify this principle by applying these descriptors to a variety of systems, including flotation processes, isomeric transformations, and interfacial molecular interactions. Although the specific chemical species in those studies differ from those in our work, the theoretical interpretation of ω as a measure of electron-accepting power remains fundamentally consistent.\nMoreover, all of these references employ DFT to compute molecular orbitals and related descriptors such as χ, ω, and the HOMO–LUMO energy gap (ΔE_gap) to rationalize interaction mechanisms. This approach closely mirrors the computational protocol used in our study, reinforcing the broad applicability and scientific validity of these descriptors in both gas-phase and surface-mediated interactions.\nIn particular, Refs. [38] and [40] highlight the practical application of DFT and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for interpreting complex chemical systems, thereby supporting our approach in analyzing donor–acceptor interactions in dye–surface systems. While the systems studied in these references differ, they emphasize the importance of dynamic simulations, which is an essential methodological aspect of our own work.\nRather than serving as direct experimental analogs, these references provide important methodological and conceptual precedents, offering a broader theoretical framework for our computational investigations. Their inclusion enhances the theoretical foundation of our manuscript and underscores the general applicability of DFT-based descriptors in modeling adsorption phenomena and electron transfer dynamics, across a variety of systems.\nWe are again very thankful for your constructive comments and the opportunity to provide these clarifications.'}]",pubpeer,"```markdown

   - Reference [38]: Cited regarding electron-accepting and donating mechanisms but the study referenced different substrates or sorbates, making it irrelevant to the claim.
   - References [39, 40]: Similarly, these were cited in relation to Mulliken atomic charges and molecular interactions in adsorbents but are deemed only loosely related due to differences in chemical systems.

5. **Clarification on Quantum Chemical Descriptors**: Although defended by the authors, the validity of including references involving different chemical systems for descriptors such as electronegativity (χ) and electrophilicity index (ω) was questioned, suggesting potential overreaching interpretation in the citations.

If, as this study suggests, cilium localization of GPR75 is critical for its biological and thus signaling functions, the obtained negative results would be expected due to ""mislocalization"" of GPR75 in these HEK-based cell systems.

While we did not specifically assess the subcellular localization of GPR75 in our HEK293T cell system, previous studies have reported that overexpressed GPR75 is present at the cell surface in HEK293 cells (PMID: 34210852).\nIndeed, we acknowledge that HEK293T cells in Fig. 7 are not ciliated. However, the purpose of Fig. 7 was to evaluate previously reported GPR75 ligands using the same non-ciliated cell system as in prior studies (PMID: 17001303, PMID: 33974269). While ciliary localization is critical for GPR75’s role in energy homeostasis in vivo, ligand-mediated GPCR signaling does not necessarily require a ciliated cell system. Notably, several studies have assessed the activation of ciliary GPCRs in non-ciliated cells, including ciliary GPCR MC4R (PMID: 33938449) and its ligand-mediated activation in HEK293 cells (PMID: 29736023).'}]",pubpeer,"```markdown
1. **Use of Non-Ciliated HEK293T Cells**: The authors employed HEK293T cells, which are largely non-ciliated, to test the ligands for GPR75. This presents a challenge because GPR75 is important for its function in the cilium, and the lack of cilia could mislocalize the receptor. Thus, the study cannot confidently confirm whether 20-HETE and/or CCL5 are true ligands for GPR75 based on these experiments.

2. **Lack of Confirmation on GPR75 Localization**: The authors did not check the localization of GPR75 in their HEK293T cell system for Figure 7. Without verifying whether GPR75 is correctly localized within these cells, the conclusions drawn regarding ligand binding are less reliable.

3. **Relevance of the Cell System for Ligand Binding Studies**: The choice of a non-ciliated cell system might obscure the findings because, despite GPR75’s role in energy homeostasis requiring ciliation, ligand-mediated GPCR signaling does not necessarily need ciliated cells. However, this assumption requires careful justification given the pivotal role of the cilium in GPR75’s function.

In the AAV-Control group, the AAV-DIO-mCherry vector was used, which carries the mCherry red fluorescent protein gene, allowing the detection of red fluorescence. In contrast, the AAV-Caspase3 group utilized the AAV-DIO-Caspase3 vector, which does not contain any fluorescent protein genes. Therefore, the red channel signal is derived from the tissue’s intrinsic fluorescence of gene expression.In the AAV-Control group, a red fluorescent background was observed due to the presence of mCherry protein in neuronal synapses, which was minimized during confocal imaging . However, in the AAV-Caspase3 group, no fluorescence signal background was detected（only see the noise), as this vector does not express any fluorescent protein genes. As a result, in your enhanced color version of the second image (the red channel one) located at the bottom left, no residual background signal is visibly detectable.\nOptimizing confocal parameters for image acquisition is a standard procedure in confocal imaging.\nWe hope this explanation clarifies your concerns.\nJuxue Li'}

The term ""conversational dynamics"" is used to describe the study of communication patterns in human conversations, such as response time and interaction flows. However, given the setting of nonlinear wave theory, it appears that the intended phrase was ""wave dynamics"" rather than ""conversation dynamics."" The dimensional Long-Short Wave Interaction (LSWI) model is derived from nonlinear wave propagation research and describes the coupling between long-wavelength (low-frequency) and short-wavelength (high-frequency) waves in various physical systems, such as fluid dynamics, nonlinear optics, and plasma physics. In terms of their relationship to viscosity in physics, classic LSWI models are frequently developed in idealized, non-viscous circumstances. However, viscous effects may be integrated into expanded versions of the model, notably in fluid dynamics and plasma physics, where viscosity impacts wave dissipation, damping, and stability. Recent research on generalized LSWI models investigates the way viscosity and other dissipative phenomena influence wave interactions, resulting in more complex wave dynamics such as shock waves and diffusive solitons.\nReferences:\n\nYajima, N., & Oikawa, M.

Can you explain what the relation is between your equation and optical fibers? There is no citation on this.'}
 {'images': array([], dtype=object), 'text': ""#3\nThank you for the valuable feedback.\nWe agree that our model is connected to the Zakharov model in the limit of dQ/dt = dQ/dx. Regarding the work of Ming-Liang et al., we acknowledge that they derived more general solutions using the Jacobi elliptic function method. Our work, however, takes a different approach. While Ming-Liang et al. focused on finding the most general solutions, we aim to demonstrate the application of the Sardar sub-equation method and a new auxiliary equation technique to this particular problem. This approach, while not yielding the same level of generality, allows us to obtain new explicit soliton solutions, which are different from those presented in Ming-Liang et al. The key distinction lies in both the methods used and the resulting form of the solutions. Ming-Liang et al. utilized the Jacobi elliptic function method to find more general solutions, while we employed the Sardar sub-equation method and a new auxiliary equation technique to derive new explicit soliton solutions. This difference in methodology leads to different solution forms; our solutions are explicit solitons, whereas theirs are expressed in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions.\nFor pointing out the apparent contradiction in Eq. (71) where c takes on complex values despite being initially defined as real. We acknowledge this inconsistency and clarify that the emergence of complex c arises naturally during the solution process. While we initially considered c to be real for simplification, the method employed extends to complex values of c, leading to the solutions presented. However, it's crucial to note that c is an intermediate parameter in the derivation and is not used in the final expression of the soliton solutions. Specifically, our primary objective is to determine W₀ and W₁ as defined in Eq. (70), which are independent of c. The complex values obtained for c represent extraneous roots arising from the algebraic manipulations, and they do not affect the calculation of W₀ and W₁ or the final form of the solutions. Therefore, while c appears to be complex in Eq. (71), this does not impact the real-valued nature of the final solutions presented. Similarly, the solutions in groups 1,3,5,6 and 10 also have a complex term in front of the exponential, after putting the values and simplification we got this type of solution according to the defined solutions (6 to 18) and (24 to 43).\nThe long-short wave interaction model described by Equation (44) is relevant to the study of wave propagation in various physical contexts, including, under certain conditions, optical fibers. Specifically, this model can describe the interaction between short, high-frequency pulses and longer, lower-frequency waves, a phenomenon that can occur in optical fibers and influence signal transmission. In the context of optical fibers, the variables J(x, t) and Q(x, t) can represent the slowly varying envelopes of the short and long waves, respectively. The spatial coordinate x represents the position along the fiber, and t represents the propagation time. The specific form of the interaction term in the equations reflects the nonlinear nature of wave propagation in optical fibers, where the intensity of one wave can affect the propagation of the other. The parameters within the equations, such as those related to dispersion and nonlinear effects, would be specific to the fiber material and operating conditions. While not exclusively used for optical fiber modeling, it captures essential aspects of such interactions and provides insights into the general behavior of interacting waves.""}

 {'images': array([], dtype=object), 'text': ""#5\n\nGiven the multitude of solutions in your paper, could you point me to a physically relevant solution that is not yet found somewhere in the literature?\n\nResponse: Respected reviewer, we appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment and have carefully examined our results to identify a physically relevant solution that has not been previously reported in the literature. Among the obtained solutions, the breather solitary wave smooth kink soliton, lump soliton, and periodic wave solution stand out due to their distinct characteristics and potential applications mentioned in an optical fiber deeply explained in section 6 (Physical Interpretation). To substantiate its novelty, we have conducted an extensive literature review and found no prior studies reporting this exact solution in the context of real applications. Furthermore, we have included a detailed discussion highlighting its physical implications, and potential real-world applications. These refinements reinforce the originality and significance of our findings.\n\nAbout c being real or complex, do equations (47)-(48) not essentially depend on the fact that a, b, c, d, δ and N are real?\n\nResponse: We appreciate the comment and would like to clarify that equations (47)-(48) have been derived assuming that a, b, c, d, δ, and N are real-valued parameters. This assumption ensures that the transformation in equation (45) remains consistent with the physical interpretation of the problem. Specifically, in the expressions θ=ax+bt and ϑ=cx+dt, the parameters a and c represent wave numbers, while b and d denote the generated waves' corresponding frequencies as mentioned in the article.\nMoreover, the structure of equation (47) explicitly depends on the real-valued nature of these parameters. The constraint d=−2ac (equation 6) naturally emerges by ensuring that the complex contribution vanishes, reinforcing the real-valued nature of the governing parameters.\n\nFurthermore, when J_1  is complex, what do we see in Fig.1?\n\nResponse: As for the question concerning the case when J_1 is complex, its effect on Fig. 1 can be analyzed by considering the nature of the obtained solutions. Since J_1(x, t) includes an exponential term e^ℓ(ax+bt), where ℓ is a complex unit, the solution may exhibit oscillatory behavior in both spatial and temporal dimensions. This can lead to modulated structures in the 3D and 2D visualizations, possibly affecting the amplitude and phase of the soliton profile. In Fig. 1(a), we observe a breather-type localized wave structure, which suggests that even if J_1 has a complex component, its real part remains dominant in the physical representation. The periodic behavior in time (as seen in the 3D plot) confirms this. In Fig. 1(b), the 2D profiles show the evolution of the soliton at different time instances, with no visible signs of complex instability, reinforcing the idea that the dominant contribution comes from the real component.\nThus, while a complex J_1 could influence the solution structure, the visualizations indicate that the real part governs the wave dynamics, making the graphical representation consistent with real-valued soliton solutions.\n\nDelete unnecessary free parameters in your Ansatz, such as different θ  and ϑ.\n\nResponse: We acknowledge the comment regarding the free parameters in our ansatz. However, the introduction of θ=ax+bt and ϑ=cx+dt is essential for transforming the given nonlinear PDE system into an ODE form, facilitating the construction of exact solutions. These parameters (a, b, c, d,) play a crucial role in defining the wave structure and enabling a systematic solution process. Removing them would disrupt the balance conditions necessary for obtaining soliton solutions. Moreover, θ and ϑ allow for a natural separation of variables, ensuring compatibility with the governing equations. Therefore, we have retained these parameters to maintain the mathematical integrity and completeness of our solution methodology.\n\nIntroduce notation such as all the hyperbolic functions with subscript μ ν And, but this should be standard,\n\nResponse: Thank you for your valuable feedback. To address your suggestion, I introduce a consistent notation for all hyperbolic functions by incorporating subscripts μ ν where applicable. This will ensure clarity and standardization throughout the manuscript. Specifically, in all relevant equations and expressions, hyperbolic functions such as sech, cosh, sinh, will be denoted as sechμν, coshμν, sinhμν, sechμν, coshμν, sinhμν wherever necessary. This notation will maintain uniformity and enhance readability, aligning with standard mathematical conventions. I carefully update the manuscript to reflect this notation consistently and ensure that all hyperbolic functions are labeled appropriately.""}]",pubpeer,"```markdown

Quite some years ago, I and a colleague wrote a critical paper noting several issues (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2011.05.023).\nTo my surprise, the article by Dombi et al cites this paper of mine in support of an equation that we do NOT support using. Specifically, the authors write ""Thereafter, binding constants (K) of the formed complexes were determined based on the modified Stern–Volmer equation39, 40:"", with reference 39 the above-referenced paper of mine.\nRegarding this modified Stern-Volmer equation, we note the following\n""Others have used the Modified Stern–Volmer equation (Eq. (8) [8], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], without realising it can be transformed into Eq. (6), and thus again involves the unnecessary use of a reciprocal fitting procedure. (8)""\n""where fa, for a binding-related process, is the fractional difference between the emission of uncomplexed and complexed fluorophore, i.e. (|F0 − Fc|)/F0. As such, fa is necessarily between 0 and 1.\nA potential problem of using the reciprocal Eq. (8) is illustrated in Fig. 4, which shows the Modified Stern–Volmer plots for the same data as in Fig. 3, where there is a significant difference between [L]a and [L]free. A linear curve fit of F0/(F0 − F) versus 1/[L]a gives a very good correlation coefficient (r2 = 0.9999), but a binding constant that is 33% of the true value, and an fa of 1.5 versus a real value of 1. Note also the excellent linearity for the full concentration range, unlike the non-linearity that can be observed in Fig. 3, giving a false impression of the methodology being very suitable.""\nSince the maximum concentration of ligand used is 6 µM, and the protein concentration is 2 µM, there may indeed be a substantial difference between L-free and L-added in this particular case.\nNot discussed in detail in our paper is the issue of ""fa"", noted as the fraction of accessible fluorophore. In a case where a ligand quenches the fluorescence of a protein due to binding, this concept is rather meaningless. At best, it is the fraction of quenchable fluorescence. That is, if it is zero, no fluorescence is quenched, and when it is one, all fluorescence is quenched upon binding. Unfortunately, the authors do not report its value, but as we discuss in our own paper, fa-values above 1 are physically meaningless and would indicate a (further) problem with the equation used.\nCould the authors please comment on these potential issues with the equation they chose to use, including why they believed my paper supports its use?'}
 {'images': array([], dtype=object), 'text': 'Dr. Poor, to whom the above refers, is unable to reply here (the system does not accept his institutional email address - ""the selected domain is invalid""), so he emailed me his reply and I am posting it here on his behalf:\n""Dear Professor Van De Weert,\nAfter I checked your comment and the manuscript, I also recognized the incorrect citation of your article [10.1016/j.molstruc.2011.05.023] in the mentioned part of the text. I read your paper few years ago, and I commonly apply it as a reference regarding fluorescence quenching and/or the basic form of the Stern-Volmer equation. Therefore, I intentionally cited it in the following sentence (Section 2.2, first paragraph):\n“Flavonoid–HSA interactions were evaluated based on the graphical application of the Stern–Volmer equation”.\nHowever, the citation of your work was accidental in the next paragraph:\n“Thereafter, binding constants (K) of the formed complexes were determined based on the modified Stern–Volmer equation”.\nPlease, believe me that I have no intention to make any misleading statement. It is my inattention and my responsibility. I am sorry for this mistake.\nI accept the critique that the modified form of Stern-Volmer equation applied has weaknesses and limitations. Typically, we perform an evaluation with non-linear fitting as well [doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2017.01.092; doi: 10.3390/ijms19124073; doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2018.08.068; doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2022.114078]. In this work, we felt that our results were properly confirmed by ultrafiltration experiments.\nIn ultrafiltration studies, MYR and M3’S showed moderate displacing effects vs. warfarin, while AMP and A4’S did not affect the filtered fraction of this Site I marker drug. These data support the lower binding affinities of the latter two compounds. It is also in agreement with the previous reports that the absence of the 2-3 double bond (e.g., AMP and A4’S) decreases the binding affinity towards albumin, demonstrated not only by spectroscopic studies but also by affinity chromatography in the past [10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.07.111].\nMYR has similar chemical structure to quercetin (QUE) and luteolin (LUT). Using the same ultrafiltration model applied in the current study, we noticed similar displacing effects of MYR compared to LUT as well as M3’S compared to luteolin-3’-sulfate (L3’S) [10.1016/j.biopha.2022.114078]; while QUE and quercetin-3’-sulfate (Q3’S) showed stronger displacing ability [10.1016/j.biopha.2017.01.092]. Moreover, in our ongoing ultracentrifugation study (where we directly analyzed the free fraction of warfarin), we noticed the displacing ability of these flavonoids in the following order: Q3’S (logK = 5.5) > QUE (logK = 5.4) ≥ L3’S (logK = 5.4) > M3’S (logK = 5.3) > LUT (logK = 5.2) ≥ MYR (logK = 5.1), which shows excellent correlation with the binding constants (see the logK values in parentheses) determined in the current [10.1002/prp2.70021] and in our previous studies [10.1016/j.biopha.2017.01.092; 10.1016/j.biopha.2022.114078]. Based on my opinion, these results (applying independent techniques) confirm the reliability of our data.\nThe binding constants of flavonoid-albumin complexes appear in the scientific literature are mostly determined based on quenching studies and these data show very large variances. In an earlier report, the binding constant of QUE-HSA complex was directly quantified by ultracentrifugation, where the logK = 5.4 value was determined [10.1111/j.2042-7158.1998.tb06183.x], showing good correlation with our previous data [10.1016/j.biopha.2017.01.092]. In the near future, we are planning to quantify the binding constants of different flavonoid-albumin complexes directly with ultracentrifugation, to further confirm our earlier results.\nFluorescence quenching is an indirect technique which has several limitations. Among others (e.g., experimental design and evaluation methodology), microenvironmental conditions and even the albumin preparation applied can considerably affect the binding constants determined. Another weakness of the model (regarding ligand-albumin interactions), that in quenching studies, the ligand concentration highly exceeds the molar concentration of albumin; while in the circulation, typically the opposite can be mentioned. Thus, the presence of much higher ligand concentration (vs. albumin) may result in further low-affinity/nonspecific interactions.\nOn the other hand, in several cases, quenching studies provide a cheap and relatively simple way for a good estimation of the binding constant of ligand-albumin complexes, with acceptable precision. Considering my previous studies, I have mostly good experiences with the fluorescence quenching technique, which typically proved to be suitable for the quantification of the binding constants of ligand-albumin complexes, and showing good agreement with the other experimental results (e.g., produced by high performance affinity chromatography, ultrafiltration, and/or ultracentrifugation). However, sometimes I also observed misleading results. Therefore, I always try to do confirmatory experiments with independent technique(s), as we also performed ultrafiltration studies in our present work [10.1002/prp2.70021].\nThe binding constants of flavonoid-albumin complexes reported in the scientific literature show large variances, we can easily find even more than 100-fold differences regarding the same flavonoid aglycone [10.1080/07391102.2013.811700; 10.2174/1389203721666201109112220]. The improper evaluation methodologies are likely significantly involved, while several other details can also be listed as the part of this problem.\nBesides the reasoning above, we are committed to publish reliable scientific data. Therefore, considering the critical comments, we repeated the quenching experiment with higher flavonoid concentrations (0-25 μM for MYR and M3’S, and 0-50 μM for AMP and A4’S), and the binding constants were also quantified by non-linear fitting with Hyperquad2006 program package [10.3390/toxins7124871] using the HypSpec2014 module (Protonic Software) and assuming 1:1 stoichiometry. Please, see the results below.\nData reported in the manuscript [10.1002/prp2.70021]:\nMYR-HSA: logK = 5.10\nM3’S-HSA: logK = 5.29\nAMP-HSA: logK = 4.74\nA4’S-HSA: logK = 4.39\nEvaluation of the new data based on Eq. 2 (modified Stern-Volmer equation):\nMYR-HSA: logK = 5.11 (fa = 0.92)\nM3’S-HSA: logK = 5.40 (fa = 0.98)\nAMP-HSA:  logK = 4.81 (fa = 0.77)\nA4’S-HSA: logK = 4.52 (fa = 0.97)\nEvaluation of the new data based on non-linear fitting (Hyperquad):\nMYR-HSA: logK = 5.12\nM3’S-HSA: logK = 5.69\nAMP-HSA: logK = 4.45\nA4’S-HSA: logK = 4.36\nThe linear evaluation of data with higher flavonoid levels gave very similar results than the earlier. Furthermore, the evaluation with non-linear fitting provided similar data for MYR-HSA and A4’S-HSA; while somewhat lower and higher logK values were determined for AMP-HSA and M3’S-HSA complexes, respectively. Nevertheless, ultrafiltration studies suggest that the binding constant determined for M3’S-HSA with non-linear fitting is an overestimation. Based on my opinion, the data reported in our work provided a proper approximation to evaluate the possible importance of these ligand-albumin interactions. Obviously, the pharmacological relevance is also influenced by several other factors.\nFinally, I am sorry for the incorrect reference of your paper in the second paragraph of Section 2.2. However, I also would like to confirm here the validity of the data reported, which were suitable for the evaluation of the albumin binding of MYR, M3’S, AMP, and A4’S as well as their impacts on warfarin-albumin interaction.\nBest regards,\nDr. Miklós Poór""\nKateřina Valentová'}
 {'images': array([], dtype=object), 'text': '#2\nI appreciate the reply of Dr. Poor, and am happy that independent techniques show similar binding constants. It is a bit unfortunate that the reference to my paper was misplaced by one line, but this is how PubPeer can provide a valuable service by informing others that read these papers. Apology fully accepted!\nI still would like to warn against the fluorescence quenching methodology, and in particular its use for binding of ligands to a promiscuous protein like albumin. Beyond possible issues with the equations, one should also consider that binding may take place in a binding site far away from the Trp residue(s), resulting in little to no binding. For binding in Site I, intrinsic fluorescence quenching likely works quite well - with the right equations and necessary corrections the binding constant will be close to the real value (whatever ""real"" really means, considering that we have taken the protein well outside its natural environment!). Binding in other sites likely does not. In fact, we have unpublished data that shows binding of naproxen in its high affinity site (site II) does not quench tryptophan fluorescence, whereas binding in lower-affinity sites, likely including site I, does result in quenching. This results in a 10-fold underestimation of the true affinity.\nOnce again I thank you for the response and hope you may consider publishing some data on systems where the quenching method and alternative methods are at odds. As indicated, those may be where the primary binding site is not Sudlow site I.'}]",pubpeer,"```markdown
1. **Use of Problematic Methodology**: The article uses a known problematic methodology for determining ligand binding to proteins using intrinsic protein fluorescence. There are significant issues with the Modified Stern-Volmer equation employed by the authors.

2. **Incorrect Citation**: The authors incorrectly cited a critical paper by Professor Van De Weert et al. in support of the Modified Stern-Volmer equation, which the cited paper does not endorse.

3. **Issues with the Modified Stern-Volmer Equation**:
   - The use of a reciprocal fitting procedure can lead to an inaccurate binding constant, which could be 33% of the true value.
   - The calculated `fa` values above 1 are physically meaningless, indicating issues with the equation.

4. **Differentiation Between Ligand Concentrations**: There may be substantial differences between ligand-free and ligand-added conditions, affecting the validity of the Modified Stern-Volmer plots.

5. **Fluorescence Quenching Limitations**:
   - Fluorescence quenching can be misleading due to its limitations and indirect nature.
   - Binding may occur far from tryptophan residues, especially in promiscuous proteins like albumin, causing inaccurate measurements.

6. **Concentration Differences**: In ligand-albumin interaction studies, the ligand concentration often exceeds the molar concentration of albumin, unlike in physiological conditions, potentially leading to low-affinity/nonspecific interactions.

7. **Lack of Data on `fa` Values**: The authors did not report the `fa` values, which are necessary to evaluate the validity of their methodology.

8. **Quenching Not Effective for All Binding Sites**: Binding to certain sites might not result in fluorescence quenching, causing an underestimation of true affinity, particularly when not occurring in the primary binding site (Sudlow site I).

9. **Variability in Binding Constants**: The scientific literature shows large variances in binding constants of flavonoid-albumin complexes, often due to improper evaluation methodologies.

10. **Responsibility and Acknowledgment**: Dr. Poór acknowledged the incorrect citation and accepted responsibility, committing to reliable scientific data and confirming the validity of their reported data after performing confirmatory experiments with independent techniques. However, there was an error in the manuscript regarding the reference used for the Modified Stern-Volmer equation.

First, I would like to express my gratitude for your thoughtful review and feedback on our paper. I highly value your comments and would like to clarify the issue you raised regarding the image overlap.\nDuring the manuscript preparation, an inadvertent error occurred, which led to incorrect image placement. The overlap you mentioned occurred between two negative controls. After carefully reviewing the original data, I acknowledge this oversight, but it was not intentional, nor does it constitute academic misconduct. Please allow me to explain the entire process.\nFigure 5 was designed to validate the interaction between two proteins using laser confocal microscopy. In addition to the two proteins of interest, we also included single protein controls and a blank control. All these experiments were performed at the same time, and we also conducted the experiment shown in Figure 2, as they share common controls. To minimize repetition, we arranged the experiment in this way. As you are well aware, when working with microscopy, multiple images must be taken for each field of view. With numerous controls, each of which requires images from different fields of view, a large number of photos were taken in total. The image overlap you mentioned actually occurred between the two single protein negative controls. Upon further review, I can confirm that the images in rows 3 and 4 are not duplicated, and the original data numbering and content are correct. Row 4 contains no issues, while row 3 contains an error due to incorrect placement during the final image assembly. However, this does not mean that the third-row control was not performed. The third-row control is actually shown in Figure 2C, where the second column corresponds to the third-row control in Figure 5, and both were taken at the same time.\nWe are currently in communication with the journal editor to correct this mistake, but as you know, this process takes time and follows certain procedures. I sincerely apologize for the error and assure you that we will be more diligent in the future to prevent similar mistakes.\nHowever, I have noticed that your comment has been widely shared and exaggerated by some domestic image-checking companies, leading to unnecessary negative consequences. These companies have used this incident to gain improper commercial benefits, while my reputation as a researcher has been significantly affected. Your evaluation of my research has, to some extent, been misunderstood, and the impact continues to expand. Therefore, I kindly ask for your understanding of my situation and request that you consider retracting or modifying your comment to prevent further misinterpretation. I fully support the founding principles of the PUDPEER platform, and I believe that neither of us would want it to be exploited for personal gain by others.\nI greatly respect your academic opinion, and I hope that we can resolve this issue through constructive and rational communication. I sincerely look forward to your understanding and support and hope you will continue to follow the progress of my research.\nThank you for your time and help, and I look forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest regards,file'}]",pubpeer,"```markdown

1. **Duplicate Values in Figure 2i**: Duplicate values were detected between different drug concentrations. Specifically, values such as 0.23346 and 0.233463 for WT, IKE 50 µM were found, which cannot merely be attributed to rounding. This raises concerns about data uniqueness across different experimental conditions.

2. **Inconsistent Explanation for Duplicate Values**: The explanation provided that duplicate cell viability results are due to consistent absorbance within the same group is challenged by the presence of duplicate values across different drug concentrations.

3. **Rounding Discrepancies**: Discrepancies in decimal digits between numbers (e.g., 0.23346 and 0.233463) arise from rounding during data processing, indicating potential inconsistencies in data handling.

4. **Identical OD Values Between Different Concentrations**: Identical OD values observed in IKE 20 µM and 50 µM for the KI-2 cell line raise questions, although it was explained as a result of high concentrations inducing extensive cell death, leading to consistent low readings.

5. **Mistake in Data Presentation for Figure 4k and 4l**: Identical values for ROS and lipid peroxidation in control conditions (without erastin) suggest a copy error. The authors acknowledged this mistake and plan to re-upload the correct raw data.

Following your notification, all authors immediately conducted a comprehensive re-examination of the original data and manuscript preparation process.\nAfter thoroughly retrospecting the manuscript preparation and raw data from 2022 before the publication process, we believe this is an inadvertent figure duplication in the manuscript preparation. Among the three images labeled with green, red and blue rectangles, the red rectangle labeled image is misused during the figure formatting and layout in scientific paper writing. The other images labeled in green and blue rectangles are normally analyzed from different perspectives in Figure 5 and Figure 6. We try to make it clear as follows:\n\nFor the red rectangle labeled image in Figure 5C of this paper, we think there is indeed a figure duplicate problem. We truly thank you for discovering it and rendering us a precious opportunity to improve this publication. The control group depicting Staphylococcus aureus under one-minute UV irradiation without any nanomaterials (""1min UV for S. aureus"" labeled with a red rectangle) was inadvertently duplicated from Figure 6A (S. aureus, 2.5μg/mL) which denoted a 2.5μg/mL addition of Cu-Cy-PEG@AuNPS nanomaterials into the bacterial solution. After retrospecting the raw data files before 2023, we found that there is an omitted image named ""UV - 273"" originally intended for inclusion in Figure 5C which is the original experimental data collected in 2022. To maintain scientific rigor and ensure proper representation of experimental data, we propose replacing the current Figure 5C with the corrected version provided below.\n\n\nTo further confirm the authenticity of the data provided, we hereby present the original data as support. As shown in the screenshot below, a folder containing the ""2 UV - 723"" image was last modified in July 2024, prior to the manuscript submission. All images in this folder originally intended for Figure 5C were created in 2022. Except for the accidentally omitted ""2 UV - 723"" image, the remaining images were correctly included in Figure 5C. Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact us for clarification. In the revised paper, the ""2 UV - 723"" image is used to replace the misused image in Figure 5C.\n\nIt should be emphasized that the generation dates of the original data regarding ""Flatbed assessment of S. aureus survival"" in Figure 5C are all before April 2023.\n\n2.\xa0Regarding the images in the green and blue boxes that are suspected of being reused, they are from the control group of the experimental group (without UV and no nanomaterials) and the experimental group (Cu-Cy-PEG@AgNPs 25 μg/mL + UV) under the same conditions for Figure 5 and Figure 6. This is an analysis of the same experimental results from different perspectives, and the authors consider it to be normal data usage. These are distinct analytical perspectives of the same experimental batch, demonstrating: a) different factors influencing the anti-bacterial effect, including UV, different Cu-Cy-based nanomaterials (Cu-Cy, Cu-Cy-PEG, Cu-Cy-PEG@AgNPs); b) different concentrations of Cu-Cy-PEG@AgNPs nanomaterials.\n3.\xa0All the source data of this paper were completed around 2023. If there is a further need, they can be provided for your reference. We are very cooperative in providing more data for reference.\nWe are well aware of the importance of research integrity. This image misusage is a serious error in our publication, and we deeply apologize for it. In the future, we will definitely be more rigorous and meticulous to avoid such errors.

Unfortunately, during the image collection process, four images were left unmarked and unlabeled, leading to some confusion.\nWhile there were no significant visual or statistical differences between the Anti-FZ group and the combined treatment (FZ+Exo) in terms of cell migration, the grouping and labeling process was complicated due to the lack of proper identification for some images. This issue was not immediately apparent to us, and we sincerely apologize for any confusion it may have caused.\nHowever, we want to emphasize that the main finding of our study—the significant effect in controlling cancer cell migration relative to the control group—remains valid and robust. Our research was conducted with great care and integrity, and this unintentional oversight does not affect the overall conclusions of our work.\nTo address any concerns, we have made the original microscope images for the treatment groups available for review, ensuring full transparency.

When conducting risk of bias ratings, a study and its protocol should be carefully examined, and it should have been evident that these are two studies of the same dataset. Furthermore, the re-analysis revealed many problems with the original publication, which should have led to a different risk of bias rating than that done by Zhang et al.\n\n\nIn the meta-analysis of trials with multiple arms, Zhang et al. did not split the sample size of the placebo group accordingly, as recommended. For example, in the Keller et al. (2001) study, there were 87 patients randomized to placebo.

We appreciate the opportunity to clarify our approach and address this important methodological consideration.\nThe explanation you provided outlines several potential strategies for handling such studies in meta-analyses, including merging experimental groups, splitting the placebo group, performing subgroup analyses, using multivariable meta-analysis, or selecting a single experimental group for analysis. While these approaches are valid under specific circumstances, we carefully considered the methodological implications and chose a widely accepted approach that retains the full placebo group for comparisons with both experimental groups (A vs. C and B vs. C). Below, we provide our rationale:\n\nAvoiding Artificial Reduction of Sample Size\nSplitting the placebo group across comparisons (e.g., dividing the participants equally between A vs. C and B vs. C) may artificially reduce the sample size of the placebo group in each comparison. This can lead to a loss of statistical power, increased variability, and potentially biased effect estimates. By using the full placebo group for both comparisons, we preserve the original sample size and statistical power of the placebo group, ensuring that the comparisons remain accurate and reflective of the study design.\nAddressing Correlation Between Comparisons\nWe recognize that using the same placebo group introduces a correlation between the comparisons (A vs. C and B vs. C). However, this dependency is accounted for in our statistical modeling, which appropriately adjusts for the shared control group. This ensures that the pooled estimates remain unbiased and valid. Widely used meta-analysis methodologies support this approach, as long as proper adjustments are made.\nSensitivity Analyses Confirm Robustness\nTo further validate our approach, we conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of including the shared placebo group on the overall results. These analyses demonstrated that the findings remained consistent and robust, indicating that our methodology did not introduce significant bias or alter the conclusions of the meta-analysis.\nAlternative Approaches Considered\nWhile merging experimental groups, splitting the placebo group, or using multivariable meta-analysis are alternative strategies, they are not always appropriate or feasible depending on the context. For instance, merging experimental groups assumes homogeneity between the interventions (A and B), which may not be the case. Splitting the placebo group can dilute statistical power, and multivariable meta-analysis requires more complex modeling, which may not be applicable in all scenarios. After evaluating these options, we determined that retaining the full placebo group for both comparisons was the most suitable and methodologically sound approach for this meta-analysis.\nWe hope this clarification addresses your concerns and demonstrates the rigor and validity of our approach. Thank you again for your thoughtful feedback, which allows us to further articulate the methodological considerations underlying our analysis.'}]",pubpeer,"```markdown
1. **Duplicate Inclusion of Study 329**: The meta-analysis included Study 329 twice, once from its original publication by Keller et al. (2001) and again from a re-analysis by Le Noury et al. (2015). This duplication was not identified despite both papers referencing the same study dataset. Additionally, there was a failure to adjust the risk of bias rating to reflect problems identified in the re-analysis.

2. **Handling of Multiple Arms in Trials**: In trials with multiple arms, Zhang et al. failed to appropriately split the sample size of the placebo group. Instead, the full placebo group size was used in both comparisons, leading to overly narrow confidence intervals and potentially biased effect estimates for 7 out of 27 comparisons in the analysis. This method is inconsistent with recommended practices that suggest adjusting the placebo sample size to maintain statistical validity.

   - ""ROC bend"" instead of ""ROC curve""
   - ""back spread"" and ""neural"" instead of ""back propagation""
   - ""concealed state"" instead of ""hidden state"" (in HMM)
   - ""convolution neural system"" instead of ""convolutional neural network (CNN)""
   - ""distinguishing proof"" instead of ""identification""
   - ""picture grouping"" instead of ""image classification""
   - ""preparing information"" instead of ""training data""
   - ""supposition examination"" instead of ""hypothesis testing""
   - ""talk affirmation"" instead of ""speech recognition""
   - ""tremendous data"" and ""big data"" instead of ""big data""

2. **Lack of Explanation and Oversight**: The authors are questioned on why they departed from established phrases and how these incorrect wordings passed through various stages of proofreading and editing by coauthors, editors, referees, copy editors, and typesetters.

1. **Figure Duplications**: In Figure 4, images labeled a & c and b & d, which are reported to represent different samples, are actually the same samples shown at different magnifications.

2. **Incorrect EDS Spectra Labeling**: In Figure 5, the EDS spectra labeling is incorrect. The peak around 2.75 keV, labeled as oxygen or lanthanum, likely corresponds to chlorine. This suggests it's a residue from the nickel chloride precursor. Additionally, lanthanum is inexplicably present in the undoped sample, and nickel is not visible, raising questions about the operational conditions of the SEM, particularly regarding the beam energy.

3. **Unusual XRD Pattern Similarity**: The XRD patterns in Figure 6 show an unusual similarity between traces for 3% and 2% La-doped NiO samples, suggesting possible data manipulation.

4. **Hand-drawn UV-Vis Absorbance Spectra**: The UV-Vis absorbance spectra in Figure 7a appear to be hand-drawn, characterized by irregular peak shapes, horizontal jitter, and inconsistent line segmentation, with no signs of experimental noise.

5. **Retraction Notice**: The paper has been officially retracted due to multiple data reliability concerns, including the duplications in SEM images, labeling issues in EDS spectra, unusual similarities in XRD patterns, and the questionable nature of the UV-vis spectra.

This raises potential ethical issues regarding animal welfare. \nFurthermore, there seems to be a discrepancy between this and the line graph in panel B. The tumor on the far left has an estimated area approaching 300 mm² according to software measurements. If we calculate the volume based on the maximum I group tumors at 30 days, the tumor depicted would be improbably thin, which is inconsistent. Additionally, it is generally expected that tumors growing within an appropriate size range should maintain a spherical shape. Only when tumors become excessively large do they tend to grow along the mouse's chest wall and adopt irregular shapes.\n\n\nSubsequently, I examined other figures within the article and identified additional issues. \nI observed a noticeable image overlap in panel A of Figure 6.

1. **Figure Chart Generation**: Concerns were raised that the charts in Figure 5A, 5B, and 5C appeared to be generated using an AI image generator rather than being plotted from actual data. This is evidenced by the unusual congealing and shaping of individual data points and the formation of networks instead of lines in Figure 5B.

2. **Discrepancies in Equipment Usage**: A contradiction was noted between the methods described in the paper's supplement, which mentioned the use of a Philips XL30 SEM, and the images provided. In Figure 3A, a Quanta FEG250 was clearly used, and the voltage settings do not match those described in the methods section. Similar discrepancies were noted in Figure 22, where the SEM model is not specified, but voltage mismatches were observed.

3. **Experimental Details for PXRD**: Figure 1 does not resemble any experimental Powder X-Ray Diffraction (PXRD) pattern, nor does it match the calculated PXRD pattern. Furthermore, no experimental details are provided regarding the powder diffraction process.

4. **Clarifications on Equipment and Methodology**: The authors responded that the Philips XL30 was used in a second, unspecified image but had been unintentionally omitted, affirming that the Quanta FEG250 was indeed used for measuring the mullite sample.

5. **XRD Data Comparison**: The XRD data for the mullite sample matched that of a previously prepared sample according to XRD card number 7105575; however, explicit comparison details are not provided in the paper.

6. **Voltage Specification**: A clarification was made that the acceleration voltage used was 20 kV, which contradicts the previous information in the methods section.

7. **Chart Plotting Method**: In response to the AI chart generation concern, the authors clarified that the charts were plotted using the Design Expert 2010 program based on experimental data, implementing various models with different factors, subsequently analyzed via ANOVA to determine the optimal model.

1. **Harmonic Noise in XRD Patterns**: The XRD patterns in Figure 2 display seemingly perfectly harmonic noise signals, which are considered unlikely and possibly impossible in XRD analysis. 

2. **Explanation for Harmonic Noise**: The authors suggest that the harmonic noise may be due to the natural formation of a thin silicon oxide (SiO₂) layer during deposition, causing additional reflections. This explanation raises further questions about the specific periodicity of these reflections, especially between 15 and 30 degrees 2θ.

3. **d-Spacings and Peak Anomaly**: Questions were raised regarding the d-spacings corresponding to the noise and about an anomalous peak with a perfectly vertical rise observed at 63 degrees 2θ, requiring further explanation for its physical meaning.

4. **Lack of Raw Data**: There is a request for the underlying raw data for all XRD spectra and the original data from the diffractometer, which has not yet been addressed in its entirety.

5. **Device and Methodology Change**: It was mentioned that the study used a different XRD system after a malfunction of the previous device (XRD MODELE D8 ADVANCE), which could have affected the results. In a prior study using the old system, no such noise was observed.

6. **Hypothetical Interpretation**: The current explanation about the unwanted reflection patterns remains speculative, with no conclusive evidence provided to support the hypothesis.

Could the authors provide the raw data for these patterns?\nDone, we attached the excel file of the raw data.\nFor the next comment of XRD, the XRD result used to show the structural changes in the composite by changing the ion beam irradiation and to prove the successful fabrication of the composite. For nanocomposite films, one can notice that all peaks of spectrum also showed in the spectra with little shifts in peaks, in which these shifts change with increasing irradiation with the polymer. This result suggests the developed interactions between various composite and irradiation that presented in the nanocomposites. In addition, ion beam irradiation also led to decreasing the intensity of bands that means the increasing of the free electrons in nanocomposite samples to be more convenient for different applications. Please note that this alteration is not fundamental and does not affect the results presented in our study, nor does it call into question the integrity of our findings.

It has come to our attention that the image used in this figure was altered by the technical operator of the SEM device, resulting in a minor change. The use of different magnifications in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for examining the same area of an irradiated film by an ion beam is a common practice. It provides a more comprehensive understanding of the material's surface features and structural modifications.  For Figure 5B, used low magnification to help the authors for observe macroscopic features and overall patterns, such as cracks, surface uniformity, or larger defects introduced by the ion beam, In the next image for Figure 5 C, used high magnification to allows for the examination of finer details, such as grain boundaries, and the induced changes in morphology of the irradiated films.

 {'images': array([], dtype=object), 'text': 'Dear Dr. Bik,\nThank you very much for your feedback. I understand your concerns regarding the images and the conclusions drawn in our work. However, I would like to clarify that IHC (immunohistochemistry) images are used as representative examples and are never relied upon in isolation to draw conclusions. Our findings are consistently supported by quantitative data to ensure that the results are statistically robust and scientifically valid. Additionally, we provide a thorough discussion of our findings in the manuscript to contextualize the data and interpretations.\nI welcome your feedback on the discussions presented in our work and am open to hearing your thoughts on whether the conclusions we have drawn are scientifically sound. I also would like to mention that we are performing follow up studies, which soon will be submitted for review. Our recent data also supports what we have observed previously. We plan to post the new data on bioRxiv  soon. I will be happy to share the link here before the manuscript is out for peer review. You are welcome to analyze our data and share your critique with us.\nRegarding the errors you highlighted, while I do not wish to justify them, it is important to note that such images are typically prepared by trainees, who may not yet have the same level of expertise as more experienced co-authors. For instance, they may occasionally overlook proper labeling protocols or make inadvertent mistakes. As the corresponding author, along with other experienced co-authors, I take responsibility for thoroughly reviewing all results, discussing them with the involved team members, and ensuring that the data presented in our manuscripts meet the high standards of the journals to which we submit.\nFurthermore, all manuscripts undergo a rigorous peer-review process, which, in this case, involved a few independent reviewers. Given the complexity of the data and the limitations of traditional review methods, it is highly unlikely that such errors would be detected without the use of AI-enabled tools, which were not available at the time of submission.  Therefore, I must emphasize that generalizing the mistakes made in the IHC images to the rest of the data is unfounded.\nI appreciate your diligence in reviewing our work and am committed to addressing any legitimate concerns to uphold the integrity of our research.  Please feel free to share any specific feedback, and I will ensure it is carefully considered. Also, please let me know if you need to see our raw data to ensure we address your concerns properly.\nRegards,\nMohsen Akbari'}
 {'images': array([], dtype=object), 'text': ""Dear Dr. Akbari, it is worrying that you blame such errors (at least 7!) on 'trainees'. It is the job of the  principal investigators to train, mentor, and supervise those trainees, and the corresponding author takes responsibility for the integrity of the data in the paper. I find it very disturbing that you are so dismissive of these errors. If a trainee made those errors, that means you did not fulfill your role as their mentor.\nYour argument that peer reviewers did not find these errors either, or that AI-enabled tools did not exist at the time of submission is also not an excuse. Doing research with rigor and integrity has always been the standard. Simply put, a lab that produces a lot of data should have procedures in place to keep track of all data. Switching samples, photos, etc., has always been problematic. You blaming these errors on a lack of peer review or tools is shifting the responsibility away from your role as the corresponding author.""}

Soc. 2025, 147, 8, 6942–6957. This work represents a significant effort in exploring superacid-participated imine COF synthesis. However, the paper contains numerous errors:\n1. Figure Correspondence Issues:  The correspondence between figures in the main text and the Supporting Information is inconsistent. For example, in Figure 4c of the main text, the reference to ""Figure S11, Figure S12... Figure S38"" should  be corrected to ""Figure S12, Figure S13... Figure S39."" A thorough check of all figure references is necessary.\n2.

Inconsistent Naming:\nThe No. 19 COF is referred to as ""TAPB-DMTA-COF"" in Figure 4c, but as ""TPB-DMTP-COF"" on page 6493, as well as in Table S5–S8, Figure S10, and Figure S30. To maintain clarity, the COF name should be consistent throughout the article.\n4.Caption-Figure Mismatches: Several figures contain COF names that do not match their captions, including Figures 6K, 6L, 7A, 7G, and 7I. These discrepancies should be corrected to ensure accuracy.\n\n\n5. Errors in Figure 6M:\nPossible incorrect COF name (TAPB-DMTA-COF?).\nErrors in structural representation and simulated structure.\n\n6) Abnormal N2 isotherm curves: The reported N₂ adsorption-desorption isotherms exhibit problems that should be clarified or corrected.'}

## Errors Summary

1. **Figure Correspondence Issues:**
   - Inconsistent references between the main text and the Supporting Information. E.g., Figure 4c's reference should be corrected from ""Figure S11, Figure S12... Figure S38"" to ""Figure S12, Figure S13... Figure S39.""

2. **Incorrect COF Nomenclature:**
   - COF No. 28: Incorrectly named 'HAPTP-TAPT-COF'; should be 'HFPTP-TAPT-COF'.
   - COF No. 27 in Figure 4c and Tables S6–S8: Listed as ""TAPT-TPB-COF""; should be 'TAPT-TFB-COF'.

3. **Inconsistent Naming:**
   - COF No. 19 referred to as ""TAPB-DMTA-COF"" in Figure 4c but as ""TPB-DMTP-COF"" on page 6493, Table S5–S8, Figure S10, and Figure S30. The name ""TPB-DMTP-COF"" should be used consistently.

4. **Caption-Figure Mismatches:**
   - Figures 6K, 6L, 7A, 7G, and 7I have mismatches between COF names and captions. Corrected names are:
     - Figure 6K: TPPDA-TFPPy-COF
     - Figure 6L: TPPDA-DMTA-COF
     - Figure 7A: TPB-DMTP-COF
     - Figure 7G: HATN-TPDC-COF
     - Figure 7I: TAPT-TFB-COF

5. **Errors in Figure 6M:**
   - Possible incorrect COF name (TAPB-DMTA-COF?).
   - Errors in structural representation and simulated structure.

6. **Missing Structure in Monomer Library:**
   - The structure of TPTA is missing in Figure 4A monomer library. TPTA-DMTA-COF is synthesized from an asymmetric TPTA monomer, which differs from TAPB.

7. **Abnormal N2 Isotherm Curves:**
   - Reported N₂ adsorption-desorption isotherms exhibit problems. The method used starts from 10^-3 relative pressure, which can show high uptake. It is acceptable for COFs with pore sizes >1 nm, but for smaller pores, starting from 10^-6 relative pressure is necessary.

We truly appreciate your effort in highlighting aspects that might lead to confusion. Your feedback has been instrumental in enhancing our understanding of proper EDS data presentation. Our group is committed to upholding the highest standards of scientific integrity and ethics in our work.\nPlease let us know if you may have any other clarifications.\nExplanation:\nThe raw data of the pristine SWCNT (raw data given below) as obtained was analyzed and found that the peaks are  accurate. However, the when the CNTs are at the bottom, the Si peak may have a slight difference (raw data given below) however, the elemental composition is accurately represented. The authors apologize for this and are immediately contacting the journal office for incorporating the required corrections. We thank you for pointing this out. Also, we checked the EDX peak position for samples where the CNTs are at the top and its accurate.\n\nIn our experiment, two types of SWCNT/ZnO NW structures were synthesized. One type of structure composed of SWCNT at the bottom (ZnO NW/SWCNT) [as shown in raw data (SWCNT at the bottom)] while the other structure composed of SWCNT at the top (SWCNT/ZnO NW) [as shown in raw data (SWCNT at the top)]. For SWCNT at the bottom, we reported two works [Acid-modified CNT/Zinc Oxide nanowires based high performance broadband photodetector, Scientific Reports, 2023 and A two-step post-treated single walled carbon nanotube/ZnO nanowire heterostructure for efficient UV photodetection, Optical Materials, 2024] and for SWCNT at the top we also reported two works [Surface modification of ZnO nanowires using single walled carbon nanotubes for efficient UV–visible broadband photodetection, Nanotechnology, 2023 and Single walled carbon nanotubes/ZnO nanowires heterostructure array for NO2 gas sensing at low ppm levels, Sensors and Actuators A: Physical, 2024]. Accordingly, the EDX data for both types of structures were reported in the respective papers. The reviewer can observe that the EDX is same for the samples when the CNTs are at the bottom and similarly the EDX is same for the samples for CNTs at the top. As for the variation in nanowire diameter, the authors have used the GLAD [Glancing Angle Deposition] technique to grow the nanowires. The GLAD method works on the ballistic shadowing effect and non-uniform variation in nanowire diameter might have been observed in the samples [1]. Furthermore, the nanowire diameters as reported in our papers were recorded from different areas of the same sample. Hence, slight variations in the nanowire diameter might have been observed [also observed in the statistical diameter plot]. As requested, the authors have now provided the SEM and EDX raw files of both the samples [raw data (SWCNT at the bottom), raw data (SWCNT at the top)].\n\n\nWe hope this clarifies your doubts. Once again, the authors are delighted by your in-depth feedback on the subject. Your feedback has been instrumental in enhancing our understanding of proper EDX data presentation. We will be happy to clarify any further confusion on the subject in the future as well.\nReference:\n[1] Hawkeye, M.M. and Brett, M.J., 2007.

# Summary of Errors

1. **Low-Resolution and Noiseless EDX Spectra**
   - The EDX spectra presented in Figures 2B and 3D are unusually low-resolution and appear noiseless.
   - The spectra peaks appear as single points, raising concerns about their accuracy and authenticity.

2. **Incorrect Peak Positions**
   - In Figure 2B, the silicon peak appears at ~1.6 keV and, in Figure 3D, at ~2.0 keV, while the expected position is ~1.7 keV.
   - The oxygen peak is inaccurately positioned at exactly 500 eV instead of its expected ~525 eV range.

3. **Repetition of EDX Spectrum Across Multiple Publications**
   - The same low-resolution EDX spectrum with identical elemental abundance quantification is used across multiple papers authored by the same group:
     - ""Surface modification of ZnO nanowires using single walled carbon nanotubes for efficient UV–visible broadband photodetection,"" Nanotechnology, 2023.
     - ""Acid-modified CNT/Zinc Oxide nanowires based high performance broadband photodetector,"" Scientific Reports, 2023.
     - ""A two-step post-treated single walled carbon nanotube/ZnO nanowire heterostructure for efficient UV photodetection,"" Optical Materials, 2024.
   - The consistency queries include why some data varies whilst other data remains identical across different papers.

4. **Data and Image Consistency Across Articles**
   - Some of the EDX spectra are repeated while others vary yet appear in multiple publications, questioned for repetition versus inconsistency in the data presentation.
   - Variations in the nanowire diameter data are noted, alongside the need for clarification on its accurate representation across different articles.

5. **Clarifications on Data and Methodology**
   - Authors’ explanation suggests the EDX spectra were derived from image files, leading to a smoothed-out appearance absent of typical spectral noise.
   - Differences in EDX data and nanowire diameter readings are attributed to the placement of SWCNT in experimental setups and the Glancing Angle Deposition (GLAD) method, causing non-uniform variations.
   - Authors provided raw data files for both types of structures and explained that variations might occur due to different observation areas within the samples.

6. **Request for Raw Data Submission**
   - Multiple comments request the provision of raw EDX data and clarification on how elements were assigned to specific peaks.

7. **Acknowledgment and Intent for Corrections**
   - Authors have recognized the issues, expressed willingness to improve data presentation, and planned to address inaccuracies by contacting the journal office for corrections.

Overall, these errors relate to discrepancies in data presentation, particularly with EDX spectra across various publications, and highlight the need for consistent and transparent data disclosure.

The using of different magnifications in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for examining the same area of an irradiated film by an ion beam is a common practice. It provides a more comprehensive understanding of the material's surface features and structural modifications.  For Figure 5c, used  low magnification to help the authors for observe macroscopic features and overall patterns, such as cracks, surface uniformity, or larger defects introduced by the ion beam, In the next image for Figure 5 d, used high magnification to allows for the examination of finer details, such as grain boundaries, and the induced changes in morphology of the irradiated films.""}

The content related to agricultural waste treatment is referenced in the cited sentence.\nSECTION 3.3. Agricultural wastes of our study are dedicated to describing the potential of agricultural solid waste as a raw material for 3D printed concrete, exploring its feasibility and benefits as an alternative construction material. Thereafter, the reference [8] is strongly related to this sentence and our study. In our writing processes, we referred to the content of this article, which is why we cited it. Therefore, we believe that citing [8] here is completely appropriate.\n[9] Reply:\nIn the reference [9], it is noted that bridges are damaged due to poor operation and maintenance, generating large quantities of construction and demolition waste that must be disposed of through landfilling. This process can contribute to significant carbon emissions and environmental pollution. By integrating the theoretical frameworks and methodologies presented in the paper with the issues encountered during waste disposal in landfills, the study broadens the scope of their application in environmental management. This expansion covers multiple areas, including environmental protection, resource optimization, data-driven decision-making, and transportation optimization.\nThis study investigates the use of construction waste (section 3.2. Construction and demolition wastes) as a raw material for 3D-printed concrete. Both studies emphasize the crucial role of concrete waste utilization in mitigating environmental impacts such as carbon dioxide emissions and pollution. Based on these correlations, we referenced [9] in this sentence and our study.\n2、\t""The main obstructive factor is the classical casting techniques that are stagnant or regressed for decades or suffer limitations due to their high human dependency, limited manufacturing precision, and lack of design flexibility [11,12].""\n[11] C.

Additionally, [11] highlights how these traditional methods can lead to suboptimal results, which further emphasizes the need for more innovative and automated solutions in the field. Therefore, [11] regarding limitation of traditional concrete is closely related to this cited sentence of our study, and we referred to its content while drafting our paper. We believe that citing [11] here is appropriate.\n3、\t""Electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorbing concrete is one of the popular functionalized concretes to prevent EMW pollution derived from radio and radar systems to computer networks and high-voltage transmitters [126,127].""\n[127] C.

Specifically, the authors mention that RFID systems are susceptible to disruptions caused by electromagnetic waves, including issues like multipath reflections and signal attenuation. These problems are common in environments with high electromagnetic activity, such as construction sites. This aligns with the potential benefits of electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorbing concrete, which can reduce EMW in such environments. By absorbing EMW, this type of concrete improves the reliability of RFID-based systems, contributing to better tracking accuracy and reduced interference from external electromagnetic sources like radio waves and radar signals. Therefore, by referencing [127], the cited sentence in our paper further highlights the functionality of EMW absorbing concrete and its broad applicability. We believe that citing [127] here is appropriate.\n4、\tIt enables efficient, cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and high-mechanical performance in 3D construction automation [133,134].""\n[134] L.

In section 4.1.1 (Optimizing mix design), our article proposes utilizing optimization algorithms and 3DPC technology (an advanced technology) to optimize the construction industry in future research, particularly in improving its cost-effectiveness, environmental sustainability, and mechanical performance. Therefore, the research discussed in [134] is closely related to the meaning expressed by this sentence in our paper. In addition, the article [134] provided inspiration and a logical framework for writing the section on future work in 3D printed concrete. This is also the reason why we cited [134] here.\n5、\t""3DCP is a new technology that allows for various materials with sustainable and environmentally friendly properties [186].""\n[186] H.

Specifically, Section 4.1.2 (Material control system during the printing process) in our paper recommends the material control system and sensors during printing to ensure the printing process, improving sustainable and environmentally friendly properties. This concept closely aligns with [186]. In the context of 3D printing, sensors monitor the chemical properties of materials, enabling real-time adjustments to printing conditions to guarantee the material\'s environmental sustainability and eco-friendliness. Importantly, we also referenced the similar sentence structures and writing style of [186], which is why we cited this reference.\n6、\t""BIM is a modeling methodology for modern construction management during the service life cycle, whereas LCA is an approach for assessing the environmental impact on all service life cycles of construction [212,213]""\n[212] Y.-H.

In section 4.2.2, our research recommends that using BIM and LCA to promote the management of 3D printed concrete improves structural design, printed model scheduling, post-printing facility management, and manufacturing procedures, reducing process damage and facilitating carbon reduction. [212] offered valuable insight into applications integrated with BIM and LCA for writing Section 4.2.2 and is closely related to the cited sentence.

It demonstrates the importance of having a robust database to manage and optimize data, a concept that parallels the use of BIM systems in the construction industry. Just as advanced battery development requires precise data management to improve material performance, BIM systems are designed to synthesize and store vast amounts of construction data, ensuring the optimization of building processes. Both fields highlight the need for accurate data modelling and management to achieve their respective goals. While the connection between battery technology and BIM may appear indirect, both share an overarching need for precise data integration. BIM not only supports the management of building processes but also plays a crucial role in long-term monitoring, predictive maintenance, and lifecycle management. Similarly, in material science, data-driven approaches, such as those employed by Ji et al., are essential for optimizing performance over time.\nTherefore, [215] helps our paper underscore the importance of data management and technological integration, concepts that are central to both advanced material development and construction management systems. Crucially, Section 4.2.2 of our paper follows the writing logic of [215], and the material data processing techniques described in [215] provide valuable insights for future research on 3D printed concrete. This is also the reason why we cited this article.\n8、\t""Furthermore, BIM technology can be used to propose flow framework systems during structural design, printed model scheduling, post-printing facility management, and manufacturing procedures [9,216].

Together, these two sentences convey that the integration of BIM and control systems (computer vision) can create a comprehensive management framework.\n[216] offers valuable insights into the role of computer vision in the broader construction sector, with direct relevance to my research on 3DCP. It reviews the application of computer vision techniques in construction and their integration with BIM to assist the entire construction process. This also inspired us to utilize BIM and computer vision CV to enhance structural design, printed model scheduling, post-printing facility management, and manufacturing procedures in 3D printed concrete construction. The integration of computer vision into 3DCP projects, particularly for quality monitoring and efficient material use, is a key aspect of modernizing construction practices.

I am also baffled why there are multiple and repetitive replies.\nHowever, I am most baffled by the authors\' explanation of  the overlapping panels in  Figures 7 and 8. They state that in both cases the two samples were embedded together into the same paraffin block to save money.  This method does not make any sense to me. These were samples from differently treated animals, so putting them into the same block seems 1) extremely risky in terms for cross-contamination or switching samples, and 2) would still never result in the exact same histology patterns. Even two adjacent sections from the same tissue would not look as identical as the two panels that overlap.\nCan the authors please retry by giving a more scientific explanation?

# Errors Identified

1. **Figure 7 Overlap**:
   - Concern raised that Panels B (NASH) and C (Atorvastatin 20 mg) appear to overlap and display similar morphological features.
   - Authors explained that the sections were acquired from adjacent sections of the same tissue block and were processed on the same slide to reduce batch-related variability.

2. **Figure 8 Overlap**:
   - Similar concern to Figure 7, where Panels B (NASH) and C (Atorvastatin 20 mg) were reported to overlap.
   - Authors stated that the sections were placed on the same slide for cost-effectiveness, following guidelines from concurrency literatures.

3. **Technical Issues in Imaging**:
   - Comments noted that the explanation of methodology does not account for the pixel-perfect overlap of images described as having differences in shift, rotation, and brightness/contrast changes.
   - Authors admitted that these overlaps were likely due to an inadvertent error during the imaging process.

4. **Justification Insufficiency**:
   - Responses from the authors were recognized as repetitive and not providing substantial alternatives to address overlap concerns.
   - Claims exist that embedding tissues from different groups into the same paraffin block can result in cross-contamination and is inappropriate for samples from different treatment groups.

5. **Use of Overlapping Panels**:
   - The authors initially claim that both study groups (NASH and Atorvastatin) have histological features that are inherently similar. However, this doesn’t justify the identical appearance of figures.

6. **Inadequate Distinction**:
   - Although similar histopathological and immunohistochemical findings were expected, the degree to which images overlap wasn’t considered justifiable by commenters.

7. **Replicability of Protocol Defended**:
   - Authors defended their protocol’s validity according to literature but avoided tackling main issue of overlap, which isn't typical for distinct sample sets.

8. **Non-specific and Confusing Explanations**:
   - Several clarifications provided by the authors were considered non-specific, and no clear explanation for the specific overlapping image duplication was provided.

9. **Scientific Integrity Questioned**:
   - The logic behind embedding tissue samples from distinct treatment groups together, leading to potential cross-contamination and sample integrity issues, was questioned.

10. **Final Admission**:
    - Authors eventually acknowledged capturing the wrong section led to the overlap, citing difficulty during imaging due to similarity in anatomical and histological patterns.

"RETRACTED: Yang et al. Capacitive Behavior of Aqueous Electrical Double Layer Based on Dipole Dimer Water Model. Nanomaterials 2023, 13, 16",10.3390/nano15010001,Nanomaterials,"[{'images': array([], dtype=object), 'text': 'The journal retracts the article titled “Capacitive Behavior of Aqueous Electrical Double Layer Based on Dipole Dimer Water Model” [1], cited above.\nFollowing publication, the authors contacted the Editorial Office to raise concerns relating to using the dipole-dimer model to represent water molecules in electrolyte aqueous solutions for supercapacitors.\nAdhering to our standard procedure, the Editorial Office and Editorial Board conducted an investigation that confirmed that results for the dipole-dimer water model are not reliable. The relative dielectric constant was arbitrarily set to 6.0 in the calculations. Considering that the value of the relative dielectric constant in the double-layer capacitor would affect the size and behavior of the differential capacitance, the arbitrary assumption of the relative dielectric constant being 6.0 in the calculation makes the calculation results arbitrary and not universally applicable. The model’s assumptions, beyond an arbitrary “residual” permittivity of 6.0 that lacks experimental or simulation-based validation, also include arbitrary parameters such as a 1.9 Å diameter and a polarization charge of 0.203947e at two sites, which are similarly unsupported by empirical or computational evidence. These assumptions result in significant discrepancies between theoretical predictions and the actual system pressures under the conditions analyzed in this article. For instance, as shown in Figure 1 [1], for electrolyte concentrations of 0.25 M, 1.0 M, 4.0 M, and 6.0 M, the model predicts bulk pressures (in standard atmospheric units) of 5546, 5742, 6537, and 7164, respectively. At 298.15 K, Figure 3 [1] shows a predicted bulk pressure of 5546. Likewise, for cation diameters (in Å) of 2, 2.4, 2.8, 3.2, 3.6, and 4, Figure 4 [1] predicts bulk pressures of 5564, 5801, 6117, 6537, 7094, and 7842, respectively. All these values are far greater than one atmosphere, demonstrating that the calculations are arbitrary, lack universal applicability, and are inconsistent with the behavior of real aqueous electrolytes. It was only during further investigations conducted after the publication of the article that the authors discovered the significant discrepancy between the theoretically predicted pressures and the real atmospheric pressure, as the publication of this article [1] did not necessitate verifying the magnitude of the theoretical pressures. This realization led them to understand that the dipole-dimer model employed in their calculations is fundamentally unreliable as a representation of water.\nAs a result, the Editorial Office, Editorial Board, and authors have decided to retract this article [1] as per MDPI’s retraction policy (https://www.mdpi.com/ethics#_bookmark30, accessed on 5 November 2024).\nThis retraction was approved by the Editor-in-Chief of the Nanomaterials journal.\nThe authors agreed to this retraction.\nReference\nYang, S.; Deng, Y.; Zhou, S.

1. **Unreliable Dipole-Dimer Model**: The results based on the dipole-dimer model for representing water molecules in electrolyte aqueous solutions are deemed unreliable.

2. **Arbitrary Relative Dielectric Constant**: The relative dielectric constant was set to an arbitrary value of 6.0, without experimental or simulation-based validation, affecting the calculation's reliability and universality.

3. **Unsupported Model Parameters**: The model incorporated unsupported arbitrary parameters, such as:
   - A molecular diameter of 1.9 Å.
   - A polarization charge of 0.203947e at two sites.
   These parameters lack empirical or computational evidence.

4. **Discrepancies in Theoretical Predictions**: Significant discrepancies were noted between theoretical predictions and actual system pressures, indicating that the calculations are arbitrary and lack general applicability.

5. **Incorrect Pressure Predictions**: The model predicts bulk pressures (in standard atmospheric units) far greater than one atmosphere, which is inconsistent with real aqueous electrolyte behavior. Examples include predicted pressures for various electrolyte concentrations and cation diameters that do not align with atmospheric pressures.

6. **Failure to Verify Pressure Magnitude**: The significant discrepancies between predicted pressures and real atmospheric pressure were only realized post-publication, indicating a failure to verify theoretical pressures during the study.

7. **Model's Fundamental Unreliability**: Investigation post-publication led to the understanding that the dipole-dimer model is fundamentally unreliable as a representation of water.

8. **Retraction of Article**: The combination of the aforementioned issues led to the retraction of the article, as decided by the Editorial Office, Editorial Board, and authors, in accordance with the journal's retraction policy.

Upon review, we identified that the linkage between lysine and glycine  was inaccurately depicted with an extra carbonyl group due to the automated rendering process in the drawing software. This discrepancy is limited to the graphical representation and does not affect the actual experimental data or results.\nTo ensure consistency, we have revised and corrected Fig. 2A, and the updated figure has been submitted to the journal. The corrected figure now accurately reflects the lysine-glycine linkage as synthesized and characterized in the experiments.

1. **Incorrect Chemical Structure in Figure:**
   - Fig 2A: The linkage between lysine and glycine was incorrectly drawn with an extra carbonyl group.

2. **Ethics Approval Timeline Discrepancy:**
   - The study, submitted in 2022, cites an ethics approval (No. TJUE-2024-335) allegedly approved in 2024, creating a timeline inconsistency.

3. **Anesthetic Use Concern:**
   - The authors used ether as an anesthetic for mice instead of the more commonly used and safer isoflurane, raising concerns about compliance with animal ethical requirements.

4. **Mislabeling in Figures:**
   - Figure 1j had a labeling error where the markers should have been '-' and '-', leading to inconsistency with Figure 1k.

5. **Incorrect Label Preparation:**
   - A labeling error occurred in Figure 1j regarding the negative control group without LPS (mislabeling as '+' and '-'), which needs correction.

According to our careful examination, we find the picture of Fig.9B is being appeared incorrectly. In the manuscript, Figure 9 presented the regulatory effect of Shaoyao Decoction on colonic epithelial barrier function in colitis mice by comparing the expression of tight junction proteins Occludin and ZO-1 in colonic tissue between groups. Figure 9B is the expression of Occludin in the colon tissue of each group of mice. Figure 9C is the expression of ZO-1 in the colon tissue of each group of mice. Compared with the model group, the expression levels of Occludin and ZO-1 in the Shaoyao Decoction group and the positive control SASP group were increased. The correct images of each group in Figure 9B are as follows:\n\nThe correct images of each group in Figure 9C are shown below:\n\nHowever, we incorrectly placed the pictures of the SASP, SYDH, and SYDM groups in Figure 9C into the SASP, SYDH, and SYDM groups in Figure 9B. The reasons for the mistake are as follows: In the initial image processing stage, the fluorescent image images taken by Occludin and ZO-1 were placed in the same large file (folder name: immunofluorescence image), and the large file also contained folders named using different indicators and different groups. In the subsequent process of combining images using Photoshop software, due to too many images, too many open folders, and the same grouping folder naming for Occludin and ZO-1, we mistakenly placed the images from the SASP, SYDH, and SYDM groups in Figure 9C into Figure 9B.\nWe will promptly contact the editorial office to submit a correction.'}]",pubpeer,"```markdown
1. **Duplicate Images**: There is a duplication error in Figures 9B and 9C, where the same set of images was mistakenly used for both figures.

2. **Misplacement of Images**: The pictures for the SASP, SYDH, and SYDM groups in Figure 9C were incorrectly placed into Figure 9B. This was due to a mix-up in the organization of files during initial image processing and editing.

3. **Folder and Image Management Issues**: The error occurred because images for Occludin and ZO-1 were kept in the same large folder named ""immunofluorescence image,"" along with subfolders for different groups, which led to confusion during image placement.

4. **Technical Error in Image Editing**: The mishandling happened during the editing session, where multiple open folders and similar naming conventions for different groups contributed to the oversight.

5. **Submission and Correction Process**: The authors acknowledge the need to provide original images for correction and have committed to contacting the Journal of Ethnopharmacology to rectify the issue promptly.

1. **Numerical Calculation Errors in Concentration**:
   - **Error #1**: The calculation for the undiluted vial concentration is incorrect. It should be 500 µg/ml (225 µg in 0.45 ml), but it was labeled as 50 µg/ml.
   - **Error #2**: The concentration for the vaccine dose administered directly to the blood is miscalculated. It should be 0.006 µg/ml (30 µg in 5 liters), not 0.06 µg/ml. These inaccuracies suggest the experiment concentration was 100 times higher than actual conditions.

2. **Misrepresentation of Concentrations**:
   - After correction, the concentration claimed to ""resemble"" the injected dose still differs significantly by a factor of 83.3. This discrepancy persists, with the supposed ""resembling"" concentration being 0.5 µg/ml compared to the actual physiological concentration of 0.006 µg/ml.

 {'images': array([], dtype=object), 'text': ""Dear Diplogasteroides nasuensis,\nThank you for your interest in our paper and for taking the time to engage with our work. Below are our responses to your questions:\n1 - We used ReNCells VM (SC008), an immortalized neural progenitor cell line derived from the human fetal ventral mesencephalon. Upon differentiation, these cells form neural lineages (neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes), though in our cultures, we primarily observe neurons (MAP2+) and astrocytes (GFAP+). Single-cell data further confirm the presence of neuronal and astrocytic markers in these populations (Supplementary Figure 1). As shown in the panels, for the neuronal complexity analysis, only MAP2+ cells were considered. Given the cell line's origin and differentiation potential, it is highly unlikely that these cells are fibroblasts or any non-neural lineage.\n2 - The cells in question are neural progenitors after seven days of differentiation, representing an immature neuronal population (MAP2+). While not fully mature (e.g., lacking significant electrophysiological activity—data not shown in the paper), they exhibit complex morphology, including long neurites, making this timeframe appropriate for assessing early neuronal complexity, which was our intention. Morphological heterogeneity is expected in vitro, and the images provided are representative examples of the cell line. Based on our experience, these cells do not undergo significant further elongation with prolonged differentiation; instead, maturation is better evaluated through functional parameters.\n3 - We acknowledge the differences between cell images and NeuroStudio’s computer-assisted rendering. While we cannot provide technical details on the software’s algorithm, it is designed for 3D neuron reconstruction (further details: https://biii.eu/neuronstudio). Neuronal morphology was assessed in MAP2+ cells using confocal microscopy at 63x magnification, acquiring Z-stacks (0.2 μm sections) to capture full-depth 3D structures. Thus, the binary 2D image representations used for publication do not fully reflect the 3D reconstructions analyzed by the software. Finally, while digital reconstructions may not perfectly match morphology, any systematic bias would apply equally across all conditions, ensuring valid comparisons despite technical limitations.\nWe appreciate your feedback and the opportunity to clarify our findings.\nBest regards,""}
 {'images': array([], dtype=object), 'text': 'Dear authors,\nI am following up on the scale bar issue. If the images are indeed representative then - as pointed out by the previous commenter - there could be a problem with the scale bar which is indicated to represent 10 micrometers.\nI would suggest you to verify this point as on the pictures the extent of neurite length is roughly around 100 um (for the longest cell) and the Sholl analysis indeed takes into account cells extending well beyond 500 um from the soma.\nThanks for your time.'}]",pubpeer,"```markdown
1. **Cell Type Confirmation**: There is concern about the cell identity in the quantification of neurite complexity and the number of filopodia. The cells in the images may not exclusively be neuronal since the paper lacks clarity on whether these cells express neuronal markers. The possibility of them being fibroblasts or other cell types was raised.

2. **Scale Bar Discrepancy**: The scale bar on images is marked as 10 micrometers, but there is confusion as the Sholl analysis suggests measurements of neurites extending up to 1000 micrometers. There is a need to verify the scale bar and image dimensions, as discrepancies suggest cells are longer than depicted.

3. **Renderings vs. Actual Images**: There is a significant difference between the cell images and the computer-assisted renderings, particularly in the number and shape of filopodia identified. The rendering software potentially over-detects filopodia, which requires more detailed explanation in the methods.

4. **Lack of Methodological Detail**: There is insufficient information on the methodologies used, particularly regarding how neurite complexity and filopodia quantifications were achieved. More detailed methods could clarify how analyses account for potential over-detection or inaccuracies.

5. **3D Reconstruction Limitations**: The 2D images presented don’t fully represent the 3D reconstructions as analyzed by the software, potentially affecting the accuracy of the morphological data. This methodological limitation needs acknowledgment, as 3D structures are summarized in 2D for publication while full assessments occur in 3D.

6. **Neuronal Maturity Clarification**: The paper discusses immature neuronal populations but the potential full mature elongation isn't addressed, which could influence the results and interpretations of neurite extension.

7. **Potential Systematic Bias**: There is acknowledgment from the authors regarding potential systematic bias in digital reconstructions, yet further clarity and transparency on how these biases might affect the study’s conclusions are needed.

Concerning Fendler,  the information is on page 366, first paragraph, the post-study HbA1c values are reported as: ""Mean post-study HbA1c levels were statistically higher in MDI than in CSII-treated patients (7.98 ± 1.38 vs. 7.56 ± 0.97, respectively; P=0.002).""   We have corrected the sign error in Babiker, which was identified as a cause of heterogeneity in the post hoc analysis and was not included in the discussion or conclusion.\nHowever, we aim to clarify this: in the amend/correction, we will use the metacont function of R software to calculate the SMD directly without manually calculating the mean difference after the intervention. This approach will clarify where the data was extracted, avoid any present or future errors, and effectively address your concerns.\nWe want to reassure the research community, including you, Reese, that we have conducted a thorough review of the manuscript. We have double-checked all the values and will promptly send the necessary amendments and/or corrections to the journal. We take full responsibility for these errors and are committed to upholding the highest standards of research integrity.\nFor your information, we have run a preview of the analysis showing that with corrections, the value is still not statistically significant, with an SMD of -0.2064 (95% CI: -0.4923 to 0.0795) under the random effects model and an I2 of 85%.

## Errors Pointed Out

1. **Incorrect Data Source Citations**:
   - The source of the mean difference figures for Fendler et al. 2012, Wilson et al. 2005, and Minkina-Pedras et al. 2009 was unclear or erroneous in the paper.

2. **Inaccurate Statistical Reporting**:
   - The standard deviation for the mean difference in Fendler et al. 2012 was reported as too large.
   - The mean difference for Wilson et al. 2005 was reported as too large.
   - There was a sign error in the mean difference for Babiker et al. 2022, which should have been -0.5 for the experimental group and 0.7 for the control group.

3. **Manual Calculation Error**:
   - There is an implication of a calculation error due to standard manual calculation methods, suggesting the need to use R software's `metacont` function for direct SMD calculation.

4. **Excel Misinterpretation Error**:
   - Excel misinterpreted the ""-"" sign as the beginning of a formula, which was not corrected during R software coding.

5. **Pre-Intervention Value Misuse**:
   - Incorrect pre-intervention HbA1c values were used due to the misquotation of values, replacing them with the median and SD of diabetes duration instead.
  
6. **General Data Calculation Error**:
   - Errors were identified in the data calculation process, leading to a miscalculation of the median and standard deviation needed for the study.

7. **Retraction Due to Errors**:
   - The article was retracted due to these errors being classified as honest mistakes in data calculation and interpretation.

Of these 6000 warnings, 3700 are APT warnings, and 2300 are uncorrelated alerts, which are alerts that are not associated with any APT Campaign (Fig. 4 and Table 3).\nAlthough the proposed system may not be able to recognize every step of the APT campaign, it could nonetheless send out an alert named apt_sub_scenario_alert when two or more APT stages are associated.\n\nGhafir et al., 2019:\n\nDue to the lack of publicly available data of APT traffic, we have constructed a 6000 alert synthetic dataset. Out of these 6000 alerts, 3700 are APT alerts and 2300 are uncorrelated alerts, i.e. they do not belong to any APT campaign. The proposed system might not be able to detect all the stages of the APT campaign, yet it still can raise an alert, apt_sub_scenario_alert, when two or more stages of APT are correlated.\n\n\n\nthis article:\n\nA new novel-based IDS for APT detection and forecasting is proposed in this study. There are two main phases to the suggested system: the first includes reproducing attack situation, and the second includes assault forecast. The proposed system’s initial phase is outlined in our previous work (Harish Kumar and Godwin Ponsam 2023). By incorporating HMM into the second stage of the suggested methodology, this has been expanded. In the first stage of this method, the attack scenario is reconstructed using the warning type and spatiotemporal parameters. The rudimentary admonitions that are related to a similar Able mission are associated through a connection structure at this step. The connection depends on the rudimentary cautions’ credits, which are produced all through a characterized time span, matching one another. The second stage of the proposed.\n\nGhafir et al., 2019:\n\nThis work proposes a novel IDS for APT detection and prediction. The proposed system undergoes two main phases, the first one is for attack scenario reconstruction, and the second phase is for attack prediction. The first phase of the proposed system is presented in our previous work [15]. This has been extended using the second phase of the proposed approach by incorporating HMM. The first phase of this approach achieves the attack scenario reconstruction based on alert type and spatiotemporal characteristics. This phase has a correlation framework to link the elementary alerts that belong to the same APT campaign. The correlation is based on matching the attributes of the elementary alerts which are generated over a configurable time window. The second phase of the proposed approach is the generation of probabilities and prediction of various stages of APT.\n\n\n\nthis article:\n\nRelevant HMM was used to produce the APT prediction. This module determines the chain of correlated alerts connected by the correlation framework in the first phase of the proposed IDS’s APT phases’ most probable order. The beginning phases of the Well-suited life cycle are uncovered by Able stage estimating, which likewise supports figuring out the goals and procedures of the assailant. Furthermore, expecting the aggressor’s best course of action is pivotal for the attack reaction since it permits the organization security group to play it safe before the assailant finishes the last phase of information exfiltration. The new Gee technique for Able’s capability is demonstrated with painstakingly designed and engineered data. The presentation of HMM approaches using the given synthetic data may be beneficial for kindling future research interests within the research community due to the lack of relevant publicly accessible data for APT situations (Al Amin et al. 2019).\n\nGhafir et al., 2019:\n\nThe contribution of this work is summarized as follows:\n\n\nRelevant HMM has been developed for APT prediction. This module employs the Viterbi algorithm to determine the most likely sequence of APT stages for the sequence of correlated alerts linked by the correlation framework in the first phase of the proposed IDS. Forecasting the APT stages not only reveals the APT life cycle in its early steps but also helps to understand the attacker’s strategies and aims. Additionally, predicting the next step of the attacker plays a key role in the attack response and enables the network security team to take the required actions before the attacker reaches the final stage of data exfiltration.\n\n\nPotential of the new HMM approach for APT is demonstrated using a carefully designed synthetic data. Due to the lack of relevant publicly available data for APT scenarios, the demonstration of the HMM approaches using the synthetic data, as made available in [16], will be beneficial to stimulate further research interests in the research community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional tortured phrases spotted:\n\n""Well"" and ""Gee"" instead of ""HMM"" (Hidden Markov Model)\n""Cutting edge Tenacious Dangers (Adept)"" instead of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)\n""Able"" instead of ""APT"" (advanced persistent threat)\n\nI cannot imagine how these could result from a manual correction of grammatical errors.'}

Two-Phase Flow Pattern Identification in Vertical Pipes Using Transformer Neural Networks,10.3390/inventions9010015,Inventions,"[{'images': array([], dtype=object), 'text': 'This article has the same issues of another article by these authors: Two-phase oil and water flow pattern identification in vertical pipes applying long short-term memory networks DOI:10.1007/s42247-024-00631-2 also inquired in this pubpeer post. The main issue is the supporting argument to choose Transformer NN framework (whch is good for time series/sequential data) when the data set stated in the article actually contains time averaged flow quantities for various multiphase patterns. The following paragraphs describe this issue quoting the manuscript.\nThis work uses the same collected data from the aforementioned article. The selected data are clearly stated in Table 1 and in the following quote of the manuscript, section 2.3:\n\nThe structure of the implemented model consists of the encoder implemented in TNN and a SoftMax layer at the model’s output. The input vector XXX  is composed of the superficial velocities of the fluids (oil and water), their sum, the in situ volumetric fraction (holdup) of both fluids, the viscosity of the oil, and the diameter of the circular cross-section pipe, as shown in Equation (3).\nX={jojwjo+wεoεwDμo}X = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{c} j_o \\\\ j_w \\\\ j_{o+w} \\\\ \\varepsilon_o \\\\ \\varepsilon_w \\\\ D \\\\ \\mu_o \\end{array} \\right\\} \nX=\u200b⎩\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎨\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎧\u200b\u200b\u200bj\u200bo\u200b\u200b\u200bj\u200bw\u200b\u200b\u200bj\u200bo+w\u200b\u200b\u200bε\u200bo\u200b\u200b\u200bε\u200bw\u200b\u200b\u200bD\u200bμ\u200bo\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b⎭\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎬\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎪\u200b⎫\u200b\u200b\n\nThe reported superficial velocity is the average value in time.\nHence, it is important to highlight that the supporting arguments on why choosing Transformer NN do not seem valid for this specific set of data, which contains time averaged values and  is non-sequential. The following quote (Section 2.1 of Manuscript) emphasizes aspects on how the Transformer NN deals with the sequential nature of inputs:\n\n\nEncoder-only: This model can convert an input sequence of text into a numerical representation suitable for tasks such as text classification or named entity recognition. The representation calculated for a given token in this architecture depends on bidirectional attention, meaning it relies on both the left and right context of the token.\n...\nFor this work, the encoder-only model is used. Therefore, the structure of the encoder block is explained in detail below. The structure of the encoder block is shown in Figure 2. A sequence of embeddings enters this block and is processed through the following layers: a multi-head self-attention layer and a feed-forward layer.\n\n...\nSelf-attention is a mechanism that allows neural networks to assign a different amount of attention, meaning a different weight value, to each element of a sequence. Therefore, the main idea of self-attention is to use the entire sequence to calculate a weighted average for each embedding.\n\nThis strong aspect of the Transformer NNs (to deal with sequential data) cannot be explored for the chosen set of data (stated above), because it does not contain any time series or sequential data (it contains average fluxes and fractions, geometric information and fluid properties).\nIt would be great if choosing TNNs could be explicitly supported and to present further explanations on why choosing it based on the problem statement and data set.'}
 {'images': array([], dtype=object), 'text': 'Thank you for your thoughtful and detailed comments on our work. We truly appreciate the time you took to provide this feedback, as it highlights important points that help clarify and strengthen the study.\nYou are correct that the dataset we used consists of time-averaged flow properties—such as superficial velocities, holdup fractions, and fluid properties—rather than time-series or sequential data. This means that the typical strength of Transformer Neural Networks (TNNs) in processing sequential dependencies is not directly utilized here.\nHowever, we chose TNNs for reasons beyond their capacity for handling sequential data:\n1.\tThe self-attention mechanism of TNNs is very effective at modeling relationships between features, even when the data are non-sequential. For multiphase flow systems, these interactions—like how holdup fractions and fluid velocities affect each other—are critical for accurate flow pattern classification.\n2.\tThe encoder-only architecture we implemented allowed us to explore feature relationships without relying on temporal dependencies. Instead, the TNN’s ability to dynamically assign importance to different variables made it a suitable tool for this task.\n3.\tOne of the goals of our study was to test the feasibility of applying TNNs in a new context: classifying flow patterns based on steady-state data. While TNNs are typically used for sequential tasks, their flexibility makes them an intriguing option for complex systems like multiphase flows.\nWe understand your concerns and agree that the manuscript could better explain the rationale for using TNNs. I also acknowledge that comparing TNNs with other models, such as dense neural networks or traditional machine learning methods, would have provided a more robust foundation for this choice. This is an area we are actively exploring for future work. Moreover, the manuscript could elaborate on how TNNs were adapted for this dataset and emphasize that this study is exploratory in nature.'}

1. **Misalignment of Technique with Data Type**: The article employs Transformer Neural Networks (TNNs) which are optimal for sequential or time-series data. However, the dataset utilized in the study is comprised of time-averaged flow properties, making the use of TNNs questionable due to the non-sequential nature of the data.

2. **Lack of Justification for TNN Usage**: The original manuscript does not adequately explain why TNNs were chosen, given that their primary strength—handling sequential dependencies—is not being leveraged in this context.

3. **Absence of Comparative Analysis**: The manuscript could have been strengthened by comparing TNNs with other models better suited for non-sequential data, such as dense neural networks or traditional machine learning techniques. This would have provided a robust foundation for the selection of TNNs.

4. **Insufficient Explanation on Adaptation of TNNs**: The study does not clearly describe how TNNs were adapted to handle the specific characteristics of the dataset, particularly how the self-attention mechanism is utilized for feature interactions in the non-sequential context.

5. **Exploratory Nature Not Highlighted**: The manuscript fails to emphasize sufficiently that the study is exploratory in nature, aiming to investigate the feasibility of applying TNNs in a novel context of classifying flow patterns based on steady-state data.

6. **Need for Enhanced Clarity**: The feedback suggests that the manuscript could benefit from improved clarity and inclusion of detailed explanations to effectively communicate the rationale behind methodological choices to the readers. The importance of these details warrants reviewer attention.

Yet, \'substantial differences are found across and within review groups over time\'.\nYou also mentioned in #11: ""Secondly, your final database cannot exceed more than 5% - 12% of the Embase number.""\n3822 is not the number of our final result; it is the number of unique hits found from four databases.\nSo, we cannot apply the result of the paper to that number.\nThe number of our final included studies is 20.\nThe 88% number from the paper also indicates that we cannot rely on only two databases (PubMed and Embase) because they do not cover 100% of the eligible articles.\nAs stated in the conclusion, we could miss about 10% of eligible studies.

We removed the duplicates.\nSo we will end up with unique papers: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O (n=15). The number exceeds the initial number in Embase since we keep one copy of each unique paper.\nYou can find similar cases in other papers (using PubMed, Embase, and other databases), where after deduplication, the number of unique papers exceeds the number in the initial screening of the Embase database with various percentages.\nSome examples:\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445318303074\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03007995.2018.1491149\nhttps://academic.oup.com/jjco/article/47/3/265/2769514?login=false\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14760584.2019.1651650\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2018.00776/full\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40273-015-0291-x\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/8/3/426\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10198-018-1006-y\nMAB'}

1. **Incorrect PROSPERO Registration Number**: The article initially provided an incorrect PROSPERO registration number (CRD4202232443), which was missing a terminal '2'. The correct registration is CRD42022324432.

2. **Similarity with Previous Protocol**: There is a similarity between the protocol used in this study (CRD42022324432) and an earlier one (CRD42020180032), raising questions about the necessity of a new study, given similar methodologies and conclusions.

3. **Contradictory Statements on Date Range**: The date of the first submission of the protocol contradicts the paper's methods section. The study states that randomized controlled trials published until January 6th, 2023, were included, but the PROSPERO submission was on April 26, 2022, suggesting a potential misalignment in the included data.

4. **Issues with PRISMA Flowchart Calculations**: The reported number of records after the removal of duplicates does not align with standard practices, as the final number (3822) exceeds the initial count (3334 from Embase alone), indicating potential calculation errors or data misinterpretation.

5. **Incomplete Search Strategy Due to Missing Brand Names**: The search strategy may have missed relevant records due to not including all potential brand names of Favipiravir, although checks on a few missing names showed minimal impact.

6. **Exclusion of Potentially Relevant Studies**: Certain studies were not included in the meta-analysis due to reasons such as not being randomized controlled trials, being a meta-analysis themselves, studying combinations of drugs, or not focusing on mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19.

7. **Repetition of Similar Meta-Analysis by Other Studies**: Questions were raised regarding the necessity of this study given the existence of similar meta-analyses published earlier by other authors.

8. **Inconsistency with Previously Published Results**: The study's results claim that Favipiravir does not improve viral clearance, which contradicts findings from other studies, such as those by Manabe et al. (2021).

9. **Raw Data Accessibility**: Requests were made to see the raw list of unique and duplicate records to verify the accuracy of PRISMA flowchart numbers, but this was challenged by the complexity and volume of data.

10. **Clarification on Database Coverage**: There was confusion over the interpretation of database coverage statistics, with repeated clarifications required on how the overlaps and coverage percentages were applied in deduplicating records from multiple databases. 

11. **Statistical Interpretation Concerns**: The statistical reasoning used to argue the overlap and final record count inconsistencies were questioned, highlighting potential misunderstandings of coverage and number interpretations across databases.

# Errors Pointed Out in the Comments

1. **FACS Panel Similarities:**
   - Fig 2A panels (Veh. Cont., BSO (36h), and HCH (36h)) appear more similar than expected from independent results.
   - Fig 2C panels (Veh. Cont. and BSO (24h)) appear too similar.
   - Fig 4E panels (Veh. Cont., GME (2mM), and GME+BSO+HCH dot plots) have unexpected similarities.
   - Fig 7D panels (Veh. Cont. Cont. siRNA and Veh. Cont. eNOS siRNA) show unexpected similarities.

2. **Blot Similarities:**
   - In Fig 6A, the pJNK blot lanes 1-2 appear similar to lanes 3-4 when background levels are adjusted.

3. **Panel Similarities:**
   - In Fig 6C, the Veh. Cont. Cont. siRNA panel resembles the Veh. Cont. JNK1 siRNA panel.
   
4. **Histogram Similarities:**
   - The histograms in Fig 6G None Cont siRNA and Fig 7B (Veh. Cont Cont. siRNA, Veh. Cont iNOS siRNA, and Veh. Cont nNOS siRNA) panels appear similar to each other.

5. **Absence of Raw Data:**
   - The corresponding author did not provide the raw FACS data files for editorial review, making it challenging to resolve the concerns about the integrity of the results.

6. **Unavailable Original Data:**
   - The original data underlying the published figures are no longer available due to the age of the article.

7. **Provision of Replacement Panels:**
   - Although the corresponding author provided replacement panels from repeat experiments for several figures (Figs 2A, 2C, 6C, and 7B), these were deemed insufficient to address the concerns about the validity of the published figures.

These unresolved concerns about the integrity and reliability of the reported results led to the retraction of the article.

 {'images': array([], dtype=object), 'text': 'Dear Professor Andrea Marshall,\nEditor-in-Chief of Australian Critical Care,\nWe would like to thank you for providing us a chance to clarify some points that raised concerns about the authenticity of the methodology and results of our study. The article is based on Mahsa Tebyanian’s dissertation that was reviewed by three referees during different steps of the research project. In addition, I supervised the project directly on regular basis to ensure all procedures and data acquisition were conducted accurately. Mahsa Tebyanian received appropriate training to conduct the study and perform all diagnostic interventions under Dr Feizi’s supervision who is a faculty member of the ophthalmology department affiliated with the Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences. The following are our response to the issues identified by a complainant and two members of the editorial team.\nRegards,\nAli Darvishpoor Kakhki, PhD,\nCorresponding author\n\nWith reference to sections 2.6.1 and 2.6.2. According to the reported methods, one single researcher, the first author, attended 66 of the subjects every six hours for five days each, to apply the therapy and record the data etc, and also the control group (33 subjects) every 12\nhours for five days. That means the researcher was there (across three different hospitals) all\nday and all night. The 99 subjects were recruited in under three months (Oct-Dec 2021), which\nmeans at any given time, seven days a week for those three months, there were at least 6\nsubjects under active study intervention, requiring intervention four times a day (day and\nnight). Based on this workload, purportedly undertaken by one researcher, it seems near\nimpossible to have undertaken the work as described.\n\nReply: Thank you for bringing this typo to our attention. As indicated in the Iranian Clinical Trial Registration Center (clinical trial code IRCT20200711048079N1), the study period spanned from August 22, 2020 to February 18, 2021 which indicates the duration of data acquisition was 6 months not 3 months. The screen shot of this site is attached to this email (Picture 1). We correct this mistake in the annotated PDF file which is also attached to this email.\n\nWith reference to the data collected – how were the number of blinks per minute assessed and reported, and by whom?\n\nReply: The number of blinks was assessed on a daily basis by the first author (M.T.) who used a digital watch to ascertain the number of blinks per minute. This point was added to the annotated file.\n\nTable 1: the data presented in the table are highly unusual. In the methods, it is not clearly written that there were three groups (other than reference to a three-arm trial) and that group 1 received artificial tears to one eye and polyethylene cover to the other – and that this was\nreversed for group 2. Table 1 reports on demographic variables. Your flow chart reports that\nyou enrolled 99 participants in the study – and that there was no loss to follow up. Why the\nsample number in Table 1 indicated 198 participants is unclear. I am assuming that there were\n99 participants (33 assigned to each group). The sample for the Artificial tears is (n=66) for\nPolyethylene cover (n=66) and conventional care (n=66). I am assuming you are reporting on\nthe number of ‘eyes’ which does not make sense for the data in this table.\n\nReply: As you mention correctly, Figure 1 provides the number of patients, and Table 1 also has to present and compare the data based on the patients not the eyes. The misinterpretation originates from the fact that the individuals in the intervention group which consisted of 66 patients received artificial tear gel in one eye and polyethylene cover in the fellow eye, whereas both eyes of the control group (33 patients) received conventional eye care. To clarify these point, we provide revised figure 1 and table 1.\n\nTable 1: It is also unclear why BP, HR, RR etc dichotomised for between group analysis? There is no justification for this, and some categories have for example n= 1 vs N=60, making such statistical comparisons non valid. Further the participant numbers in each group to not always add up to 66 participants yet it is difficult to understand how you might have missing data for a variable such as heart rate.\n\nReply: As mentioned previously, the misinterpretation originates from the fact that the individuals in the intervention group which consisted of 66 patients received artificial tear gel in one eye and polyethylene cover in the fellow eye, whereas both eyes of the control group (33 patients) received conventional eye care. To clarify these point, we provide revised table 1. Mean and standard deviation was used to express continuous variables in revised table 1.\n\nThroughout the study were no reported loss to follow up. You indicate that patients were excluded if they blinked more than 5 times per minute. While this might be able to be assessed on enrolment, how was this assessed throughout the study. It is unusual that no patients in the study were discharged from the ICU or demonstrated return of the blinking reflex during the study period.\n\nReply: Only two patients died on the second day of study who were replaced with new patients. We added this to the article. All patients enrolled at this study had GCS below 7 and were within 24 hours of their admission. This point was added to the article. Practically, it is not common to discharge these patients from ICU in a five-day period after their admission to ICU. Also, blinking reflex of each patient was checked by M.T. on a daily basis in the morning and did not return during these five days of this study. This point was added to the article.\n\nSection 3 – Measurement: The introductory sentences which relate to content validity are very confusing and it would be logical to make the assumption that this might have been a survey but with no data presented. I believe this to be poor reporting of what occurred and am presuming that you sought opinion on what demographic variables to collect in this study\n(which is not content validity assessment).\n\nReply: We prepared this section in response to the reviewers. However, we agree with you and believe that this section had nothing to add to the concept of this study. Therefore, we opt to remove this section from the article.\n\nSection 3 – Measurement: In the second paragraph you indicate “In all three formulae (what formulae are these?), the obtained answer was multiplied by 100 to get the result in percentage form”. This is very unclear as to what you did, why and the basis for these recommendations.\n\nReply: We remove this part from the article. Please, see our response to comment 6.\n\nTable 2: means and standard deviations are used to describe the results of two scores, neither of which is parametric, and one of which is dichotomous. You will also see (section 4.1) that ANOVA was used to analyse those categorical results. The outcome data appears to be\npresented as true or false. If this is the case it is unclear what data manipulation would allow\nrepeated measures ANOVA. While this is not a data integrity issue, the method of analysis does\nbring the accuracy of the results reported into question. These results are repeated in figures 2\nand 3.\n\nReply: Unfortunately, table 2 and figures 2 and 3 present the results in a wrong manner. Therefore, we provide revised table 1 and figures 2 and 3 to correct the mistakes. In addition, we revise the statistical analysis section to demonstrate the statistical tests used in our study.\n\nExclusion of patients with raised intracranial pressure is not clearly described. This is particularly important to report how many patients were included and how/when ICP was assessed.\n\nWe did not consider ICP variable in inclusion or exclusion criteria of this research for two reasons. First of all, ICP measurement is performed in our centers based on clinical signs and symptoms and is not a routine procedure for patients in the ICUs. Secondly, we could not find any studies that support the effect of ICP on eye dry or corneal ulcer.\n\nI note acknowledgement of Professor Judith Hall for English editing. Please provide Professor Hall’s contact details so we can determine the approach to editing that was used.\n\nProfessor Judith Hull is a distinguished professor at the Northeastern University in the US. She has been my research mentor for more than 15 years and review and comment nearly all my published articles. I use this email to reach her “ j.hall@northeastern.edu “.  I have always used her email and received her response quickly.'}]",pubpeer,"```markdown
1. **Data and Methodological Irregularities**: Concerns have been raised about the data and methodologies used in the study, prompting an investigation by the journal's editors in line with COPE guidelines.

2. **Single Researcher's Workload**: The workload expected from the single researcher (the first author) appears to be implausible, as it involves attending to numerous subjects across different hospitals continuously over a specified period.

3. **Typographical Error in Study Period**: The study period was inaccurately reported as three months instead of the correct six months.

4. **Assessment of Blinking**: Clarification was needed on how and by whom the number of blinks per minute was assessed during the study.

5. **Inconsistencies in Participant Numbers**: Discrepancies in participant numbers were noted in Table 1, where 198 participants were mentioned instead of the correct 99 participants. The misinterpretation arose because of the manner in which numbers were recorded based on ""eyes"" rather than ""patients.""

6. **Dichotomization in Data Analysis**: The justification for dichotomizing variables like BP, HR, RR was unclear, and some categories had nonsensical statistical comparisons (e.g., n=1 vs N=60).

7. **No Reported Loss to Follow-Up**: The report indicated no loss to follow-up, although it was noted that excluding patients who blinked more than five times per minute is usually assessed at enrollment.

8. **Content Validity in Measurement Section**: The introductory sentences in Section 3 about content validity were confusing and inaccurately reported.

9. **Inadequate Explanation of Formulae**: In Section 3, statements about multiplying answers by 100 to convert to percentage were unclear and lacked justification.

10. **Incorrect Presentation of Results in Table 2 and Figures**: The results in Table 2, and associated figures, used inappropriate means and standard deviations for non-parametric and dichotomous data. The use of ANOVA on categorical data questions the accuracy of reported results.

11. **Exclusion Criteria Clarity**: Exclusion concerning raised intracranial pressure (ICP) wasn't clearly described, though ICP was not considered a variable for inclusion/exclusion for specific reasons.

12. **English Editing Acknowledgement**: Contact details of Professor Judith Hall, who provided English editing, were requested to verify the approach used.

1. **Similarity in Traces' Noise**: The noise profiles in Fig. 2 are reported to be very similar, raising concerns as experimental noise should not be identical across different measurements.

2. **Band Gap Energy Calculation Error**: The method for deriving band gap energies from Tauc plots is incorrect. The linear part of the plot should be extrapolated to y = 0, and the band gap energy (Eg) should be read on the abscissa axis.

3. **XRD Patterns Similarity**: The XRD patterns of amorphous materials are extremely similar, showing identical profiles with broad humps and no strong diffraction peaks.

4. **Vertical Stretch Misleading**: The comparison between end composition patterns, ZBSL0 and ZBSL10, is misleading due to vertical stretching, despite their chemical compositions being significantly different.

5. **Chemical Composition Impact**: The description of the ZBSL0 and ZBSL10 glass samples suggests the impact of La2O3 content on XRD is not significant due to its non-glass-forming nature. Additionally, there's an unaddressed issue about some deleted points on the abscissa axis for band gap plots.

6. **Experimental Noise Concerns**: There is skepticism about the identical noise profiles in XRD patterns and whether they are replicable between measurements given the nature of experimental noise.

1. **XRD Patterns Painted**: The XRD patterns in the paper are allegedly artificially created or ""painted,"" with an indication that insufficient noise was added in certain areas at the beginning of the patterns.

2. **Duplicate Value on Abscissa**: In Fig. 1(a), there was an issue with the abscissa moving to the left, resulting in the appearance of two instances of the value “10” due to compatibility issues with the software version used (Origin).

1. **Animal Welfare Concerns:**
   - Tumors in Figure 1 C/D exceed the maximum size allowed under ethical standards (2000 mm³ and 2 cm in length), particularly in the PBS-treated group, potentially causing severe bowel obstruction and adverse clinical signs.

2. **Similarity and Inconsistency in Figures:**
   - The PBS mouse in Figure 3C appears similar to the Ctrl mouse in Figure 7B, but descriptions in the legends indicate different experiments and control groups. Figure 3C involves gavage, while Figure 7B involves regular drinking water or water with monoclonals.

3. **Identical Tumor Sets in Different Figures:**
   - Identical sets of tumors are highlighted between Figures 3C (bacterial gavage) and Supplemental Figure S2A (bacterial injection). Some tumors have been rotated 90 degrees between figures.

4. **Inconsistency in Tumor Sizes:**
   - The same tumors are reported to have different sizes (approximately 2 cm versus 1.5 cm) in Figures 3C and Supplemental Figure S2A.

5. **Explanation and Corrections:**
   - An admission of not labeling images well, leading to potential misuse of the wrong images, and a suggestion of a collection of tumor pictures being used at will. The explanation of how these errors occurred and the measures to rectify them has been requested.

First of all for the ice nucleation temperature test, we are letting the sample surface cool down at a uniform rate of 0.5°C/min.The ice nucleation temperature (TIN) of the coating was defined by the temperature where the water droplet converted from transparent to opaque within 1 s under the optical microscope.There were experimental errors in the process (e.g., the ice nucleation temperature measurements varied from one part of the coating to another and from one test to another, fluctuating up and down, and we took the average value).It is worth noting that we measured the ice nucleation temperature at a cooling rate of 0.5°C/min (the instrumentation was limited to this cooling rate), and it took 2640 s to cool down the surface from 0°C to -22°C, whereas the ice nucleation temperatures in the recent literature have been measured at a cooling rate of 5°C/min, and it took only 264 s to cool down the surface from 0°C to -22°C. The temperature of the ice nucleation temperature in the recent literature was measured at a cooling rate of 5°C/min, and it took only 264 s to cool down the surface from 0°C to -22°C.（[1] DOI: 10.1002/smll.202206075  [2] 10.34133/research.0140 ）\nWe know that even at 0°C, water droplets freeze after a sufficiently long cooling time, and the cooling time during our ice nucleation experiments was longer compared to others in the literature ([1] DOI: 10.1002/smll.202206075 [2] 10.34133/research.0140 ), with a 0.5°C/min cooling rate that was too slow, and a longer subcooling time , which causes the ice nucleation temperature to be high compared to literature measurements of 5°C/min cooling rate.\nHere we have also done experimental verification, we have prepared the coating in the literature [1], and found that in the literature described in 5 ℃ / min cooling rate, the ice nucleation temperature TIN = -30.3 ℃, but in our cooling rate of 0.5 ℃ / min, the subcooling time is too long, TIN = -19 ℃. That is, if we switch to a cooling rate at 5°C/min, the TIN of our article would be over -30°C due to the short subcooling time. So due to the different cooling rates, our measured ice nucleation temperature would be higher than the 5°C/min result, and we accurately described our cooling rate in our article, which we did not take due to instrumental limitations.So at -30℃, we still have more than 400 seconds of delayed droplet freezing time (for the delayed droplet freezing, we have provided pictures with the original timestamps to prove it,average of multiple measurements, we observe the time when the tip of the droplet appeared, Td=Ti+Tf, where Ti (icing time) is the time elapsed while reaching the phase transition temperature after the droplet reaches 0 °C, and Tf (freezing time) is the amount of time that passes from the beginning of the phase transition to the complete freezing of the droplet. And for the ice nucleation temperature, we observe the temperature when the transparency of the droplet changed. \nWe will continue to improve our testing methods here as well.'}]",pubpeer,"```markdown
# Summary of Errors

1. **Discrepancy in Freezing Delays and Temperatures**: The test temperatures for freezing delay time in Figure 7 are mentioned as -30°C, which is lower than the cited freezing temperature of -22.1°C for ASPF0.8-PT0.2 coatings. This discrepancy indicates a misunderstanding of the definitions and testing methods for freezing delay time and freezing temperature, which questions the validity of the experimental results.

2. **Inconsistency in Ice Nucleation Temperature Measurements**: The measurement of ice nucleation temperature (TIN) fluctuated from one part of the coating to another and from one test to another. This inconsistency raises concerns about the reproducibility and reliability of the measurements.

3. **Cooling Rate Differences Affecting Results**: The measurements were made at a cooling rate of 0.5°C/min due to instrument limitations, contrary to the standard literature practice of 5°C/min. This slower cooling rate leads to a longer subcooling time, resulting in a higher measured ice nucleation temperature compared to other studies, affecting the validity of the comparative results.

4. **Unverified Cooling Rate Claim**: The authors claim that if their measurements had been done at the standard 5°C/min rate, the TIN would be over -30°C. However, this is an assumption rather than an experimentally verified result, as they describe different results based on literature rather than direct comparison.

5. **Ambiguity and Confusion in Measurements Reporting**: There is a lack of clear explanation on how exactly the measurements for both the ice nucleation temperature and freezing delay time were carried out. The methodology described appears confusing and does not align with standard practices, pointing to a need for improved and more transparent reporting.

6. **Potential Experimental Error and Data Representation**: Although reference to experimental pictures with original timestamps is made, it is not clear whether this correlates with the inconsistencies observed in the numerical results, suggesting a potential error in data representation. The explanation indicates an average value from multiple measurements, but specifics about error analysis and data handling are inadequate.

7. **Overall Instrumentation and Method Limitations**: There are admitted limitations with the instrumentation and methodology used, implying that the results may not be fully reliable or comparable to existing literature without improvements to the testing methods.

The authors acknowledge these issues and express an intention to continue improving their testing methods.

Greenhouse Gas Theory, after citing some high-level explanation of the greenhouse effect by IPCC, the author claims :\n\n\nThis sort of statement is not comprehensible to the average person, makes no sense scientifically and is\nimmediately falsified by recent research (Seim and Olsen, 2020; Coe etal., 2021; Lange et al., 2022, Wijngaarden\n& Happer, 2019, 2020, 2021(a), 2021(b), 2022, Sheahen, 2021; Gerlich & Tscheuschner, 2009; Zhong & Haigh,\n2013).\n\nThere is however no substantiation why the IPCC explanation would make no sense scientifically and how it is falsified by the mentioned sources. In reality Wijngaarden & Happer papers actually confirm the ""non sensical"" explanation from IPCC and find very similar results as IPCC (sensitivity to CO2 doubling between 1.4°C and 2.2°C depending on assumptions - see Wijngaarden & Happer 2020, table 5).\n\nIn table 2 again the Wijngaarden & Happer papers are presented as opposing to IPCC estimates, while they are not and find similar results.\n\n\n\nIn section 3.1.3 Other Falsifications author presents papers that contradict  ""IPCC’s attribution of 80% of warming to  water vapor (~5% in air) and 20% to CO2 (~0.04% in air)"" but omits to mention that Wijngaarden & Happer papers do actually confirm this attribution (see Wijngaarden & Happer 2020, table 2) - that could be interpreted as selection bias.'}
 {'images': array([], dtype=object), 'text': 'Additional comments to #3 :\n\nIn section §3.1.2 the author states :\n\n\nThe important point here is that the Ideal Gas Law, the logarithmic absorption of radiation and the theoretical\ncalculations by Wijngaarden & Happer (2020 and 2021), Coe et al., (2021) based on the Beer-Lambert Law and\nthe Stephan-Boltzmann Law show that there is an upper limit to the temperature change which can occur by adding\n‘greenhouse gases’ to the atmosphere if the main source of incoming radiation (the Sun) does not change over time.\nThe upper limit is ~1.85°C.\n\nThis result is again not supported by at least one of the sources:  Wijngaarden & Happer 2020 explicitely mentions a value between  1.4°C and 2.2°C (see table 5).\n\n\nSection §3.1.4  exhibits a  logical fallacy by making a calculation on CO2 fluxes (result : anthropogenic CO2 emission is 4.3% of all CO2 emissions) and infering that the same value of 4.3% would apply to CO2 stock. This is incorrect reasoning as shown by   figure 5-12 of IPCC AR6 WG1\n\n\nIn section §3.1.4 the author also omits to mention the multiple lines of evidences that contradict his evaluation of the anthopogenic part of CO2 stock in the atmosphere by a factor of 10 - see for instance IPCC AR 6 WG1 §5.2.1 :\n\n\n\nMultiple lines of evidence unequivocally establish the dominant\nrole of human activities in the growth of atmospheric CO2. First, the\nsystematic increase in the difference between the MLO and SPO\nrecords (Figure 5.6a) is caused primarily by the increase in emissions\nfrom fossil fuel combustion in industrialized regions that are situated\npredominantly in the Northern Hemisphere (Ciais et al., 2019). Second,\nmeasurements of the stable carbon isotope in the atmosphere (d13C–\nCO2) are more negative over time because CO2 from fossil fuels\nextracted from geological storage is depleted in 13C (Figure  5.6c;\nRubino et al., 2013; Keeling et al., 2017). Third, measurements of the\nd(O2/N2) ratio show a declining trend because for every molecule of\ncarbon burned, 1.17 to 1.98 molecules of oxygen (O2) is consumed\n(Figure 5.6d; Ishidoya et al., 2012; Keeling and Manning, 2014). These\nthree lines of evidence confirm unambiguously that the atmospheric\nincrease of CO2 is due to an oxidative process (i.e.,  combustion).\nFourth, measurements of radiocarbon (14C–CO2) at sites around the\nworld (Levin et al., 2010; Graven et al., 2017; Turnbull et al., 2017)\nshow a continued long-term decrease in the 14C/12C ratio. Fossil fuels\nare devoid of 14C and therefore fossil fuel-derived CO2 additions\ndecrease the atmospheric 14C/12C ratio (Suess, 1955).\n\n\nOver the past six decades, the fraction of anthropogenic CO2\nemissions that has accumulated in the atmosphere (referred to as\nairborne fraction) has remained near constant at approximately\n44%  (Figure 5.7) (Ballantyne et al., 2012; Ciais et al., 2019; Gruber\net al., 2019b; Friedlingstein et al., 2020). This suggests that the land\nand ocean CO2 sinks have continued to grow at a  rate consistent\nwith the growth rate of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, albeit with\nlarge interannual and sub-decadal variability dominated by the land\nsinks (Figure 5.7)'}]",pubpeer,"```markdown
1. **Incorrect Logarithm Usage**: In section 3.1.2, the author mistakenly used the log base 10 function instead of the natural logarithm (neperian) in calculations using the IPCC equation. This resulted in incorrect numerical results.
   
2. **Misrepresentation of Sources**: The author claims that IPCC explanations make no scientific sense and are falsified by Wijngaarden & Happer and similar studies. However, these studies actually provide results similar to the IPCC, contrary to what is suggested in the paper.

3. **Error in Table Presentation**: In table 2, it's indicated that Wijngaarden & Happer papers oppose IPCC estimates, which is misleading since their findings are actually in agreement with IPCC.

4. **Selection Bias**: In section 3.1.3, the author references studies that contradict IPCC's attribution of warming to water vapor and CO2 but omits mentioning that Wijngaarden & Happer actually confirm these attributions.

5. **Unsupported Claims on Upper Limit of Temperature Change**: The claim that there is an upper limit of ~1.85°C for temperature change due to greenhouse gases, as mentioned in section §3.1.2, is not supported by the cited sources like Wijngaarden & Happer, who report a range of 1.4°C to 2.2°C.

6. **Logical Fallacy in CO2 Calculations**: In section §3.1.4, there is a flawed inference that the percentage of anthropogenic CO2 emission is directly applicable to CO2 stock, which contradicts IPCC findings.

7. **Omission of Counter Evidences**: The author overlooks multiple lines of evidence that challenge the evaluation of anthropogenic CO2 stock—such as fossil fuel signatures in carbon isotopes and the constant airborne fraction—thereby underestimating human impact by a factor of 10.

Additionally, the classification of O-terminated Ga2O3 and SiO2 surfaces as high-energy surfaces was mentioned. We acknowledge that comparing models with different atomic terminations can indeed be problematic. However, for the van der Waals contact Ga2O3-MoS2 interface in our study, the traction-separation law during the separation of MoS2 from Ga2O3 does not exhibit significant differences between the O-terminated and Ga-terminated Ga2O3.\nTo address these concerns, we recalculated the system’s energy and mechanical properties associated with the peeling of the O-terminated Ga2O3 from MoS2, as shown in Figure 1. The calculated interaction force was determined to be 0.176 eV/ Å, and the minimum peeling force was 3.5 N/m. These values are sufficient to retain the oxide film on MoS2. Moreover, in our simulations, fully bonded O atoms on the surface of Ga2O3 are quite common[2-6]. In our computational model, each O atom is fully bonded to two adjacent Ga atoms.\nRegarding the Ga2O3/SiO2–CH3 model, it is accurate that the SiO2 is O-terminated on the side remote from the interface, which may elevate the energy of the SiO2. However, since our primary focus in on the interfacial energy, the contribution from the O-terminated edge away from the interface is effectively subtracted during the calculating of the interaction force. Thus, it does not significantly affect the final minimum peeling force.\n\nFigure 1. Density functional theory calculation. a.

1. **Inconsistency in Atomic Models**: The atomic model used in the DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations in Figure S14 shows irrationality due to inconsistent atomic terminations. Figure S14a uses a Ga-terminated model, while Figures S14d, S14g, and S14j use O-terminated models. This inconsistency makes the comparison between models meaningless and the conclusions unreliable.

2. **Use of High-Energy Surfaces**: The calculation model incorporates high-energy surfaces such as O-terminated Ga2O3 and O-terminated SiO2. This choice can lead to results that are significantly different from experimental observations.

3. **Discrepancy with Experimental Results**: The use of high-energy surfaces (specifically O-terminated surfaces) is likely to result in discrepancies when compared to experimental findings, as the adopted computational model may not accurately represent the experimental conditions.

1. **EDX Spectrum Concerns:**
   - **No Gold Peaks in Spectrum:** The EDX spectrum in Inset a7 of Figure 2 lacks visible gold peaks, despite the presence of gold being claimed in the elemental abundance table.
   - **Mismatch in Elemental Percentages:** There is a discrepancy between the claimed weight/mass percentages and the atomic percentages in the table, notably:
     - Carbon (C): Claimed Wt% is 42.2 and At% is 46.4, whereas the calculated Wt% is 11.1.
     - Copper (Cu): Claimed Wt% is 27.7 and At% is 25.9, with a calculated Wt% of 32.7.
     - Oxygen (O): Claimed Wt% is 16 and At% is 14.5, compared to a calculated Wt% of 4.6.
     - Gold (Au) / Silver (Ag): Claimed Wt% is 14.1 and At% is 13.2, opposed to a calculated Wt% of 51.6 for Au, unclarified for Ag.

2. **Typographical Error in Elemental Table:**
   - **Gold (Au) vs. Silver (Ag):** The authors identified a typographical error where ""Au"" was used instead of ""Ag."" Yet, even with this correction, the claimed atomic percentages remain incompatible with the claimed weight percentages.
   - **Clarification Requested:** Further clarification sought on a statement regarding the high percentage of carbon (C) instead of silver (Ag) in the context of the EDX analysis.

3. **Shared Images Across Multiple Publications:**
   - **Duplicate Images in Multiple Articles:** The same images of cuvettes, supposedly depicting different material fluorescence, are used across at least four articles by common authors.
   - **Need for Original Images:** Inquiry made for the original images and their accurate context to verify representation in each article.
   - **Rationale for Similarity in Images:** Authors explain similarity due to a common experimental setup and similarity in fluorescence characteristics of the compounds studied (Rose Bengal dye and cinnamon nanoparticles), though further verification is suggested.

1. The dithizone-stained image in Figure 3B appears to be a red-adjusted version of the brightfield image with some slight modifications, which raises questions about the authenticity of the staining process depicted.
   
2. Dithizone staining typically requires incubation with a zinc-chelating agent that binds to insulin secretory granules, visible under brightfield imaging. It seems highly improbable that the dithizone-stained image (bottom row) for S6 iPSC islets can be the exact same as the unstained image (top row), contradicting the figure caption.

3. Simple manipulation using ImageJ on the unstained image can potentially recreate an image that is indistinguishable from the supplied ""dithizone-stained"" image, further questioning the integrity of the staining images.

4. A similar pattern emerges between unstained and dithizone-stained SC-islets in Figure S4, suggesting potential inconsistencies or issues with the portrayal of these images.

Fig.S12b presented the intracellular delivery efficiency of common liposome (denoted as Lipo), reflecting a negligible membrane fusion ability, thus resulting in the weak efficiency of intracellular delivery.

The specific operation is that the pictures of Lipo@cy5, M-MFL, MFL and control groups are put together by an adobe illustration software. In the subsequent image processing process, for typographical beauty, we want to move the pictures of Lipo@cy5 group into the supplementary material in the manuscript. Due to operational error from too many pictures, we mistakenly put the picture of control group in Fig. S12 into the supplementary material.

# Summary of Errors

1. **Reused Images with Different Exposure Levels**: 
   - Figure 4b and Supplementary Figure 12 were found to use the same image but with different exposure levels. The original purpose appeared to highlight different results with the same image, which is potentially misleading.

2. **Incorrect Image Placement**:
   - The original images for the control group in Figure 4b were mistakenly placed into Figure S12b instead of images for the Lipo@cy5 group. This misplacement was due to an operational error during the image processing phase.

3. **Initial Image Processing Mistake**:
   - During the image processing phase, images intended for comparison in Figure 4b were incorrectly grouped and subsequently led to an error when moving Lipo@cy5 group images to the supplementary material.

4. **Image Misplacement Acknowledged by Authors**:
   - The authors acknowledged the error publicly and stated that they have contacted the editor-in-chief and managing editor to request correction of Figure S12b. They asserted that the error does not affect the accuracy of the study's results as it was verified by CLSM and flow cytometry, maintaining consistency in their conclusion.

1. **Inconsistency in Data Representation**: In Supplementary Figure 5, the control group (p16) reportedly has only two visible data points, despite the figure legend stating a sample size of n=3-5. It was clarified that two samples were overlapped due to close values, but this explanation still presented a visual discrepancy.

2. **Mathematical Inconsistency**: There is a reported mathematical inconsistency in the same figure. The distances between the upper point(s), lower point, and the mean are identical, which mathematically requires either exactly two data points symmetrically positioned around the mean or an improbable symmetric distribution if there are three data points. This raises questions about the true number of data points and whether the mean value was correctly computed.

3. **Request for Raw Data**: To resolve the ambiguity regarding the number of data points and the calculation of the mean, a request was made for the raw values of the data points in question.

1. **Image Similarity Concerns**: Several images are noted to be ""much more similar than expected,"" raising concerns about the originality or potential duplication of data.

2. **Same Tissue Section**: One image seems to originate from the same tissue section, suggesting possible redundancy or incorrect labeling.

3. **Spliced Image Mismatches**: Errors were identified in a spliced image, indicating multiple mismatches within the images referenced, affecting the integrity of the data presentation.

4. **Flow Cytometry Chart Differences**: Despite alleged differences between published flow cytometry charts and provided images, the similarities are explained as a consequence of close cell ratios. However, the validity of this explanation remains questioned.

5. **Overlapping IHC Staining**: Overlap in shape in IHC staining images is observed, explained by continuous slices, albeit inconsistencies in expression levels are noted, suggesting potential usage of different antibodies.

6. **Misuse of Images**: An error reflecting misuse of images due to naming and labeling issues is admitted, yet claimed not to affect the article's conclusions. The authors have contacted the editor for a corrigendum and offered to provide original images.

7. **Data Completeness Clarification**: The authors emphasize the breadth of data (~100 stained pictures, implying over a thousand original data images) and ensure their conclusions are derived from statistical analyses of multiple photographs. Despite this assurance, issues with proper presentation and image usage are acknowledged.

 {'images': array([], dtype=object), 'text': '#1\nThank you for your thoughtful comments and for raising these points regarding our figures.\nWith respect to the schematic diagram in Figure 1, it is a simplified cartoon representation intended to illustrate the multivalent interactions between the cyanine dye and the cyclodextrin polymer (CDP). The blue spheres are used to emphasize the potential binding sites on the cyanine dye for CDP, rather than to depict the precise chemical structure or bonding arrangement. While the indole benzene ring and adamantane are depicted using similar visual elements for simplicity, this choice was made to convey the multivalent nature of the interactions and was not intended to imply that the benzene ring of indole or benzoindole shares identical binding characteristics with adamantane.\nRegarding the binding interactions, fluorescence titration experiments (summarized in Tables S1 and S2 in the supplementary materials) confirm that cyclodextrin can encapsulate cyanine dyes. The introduction of adamantane groups increases the association constant, indicating effective encapsulation of these groups by cyclodextrin. Furthermore, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) results (Figures S2 and S3 of the supplementary materials) demonstrate interactions between Cy7.5AA and CDP (Fig. S2) or HPβCD (Fig. S3). The observed binding stoichiometry of Cy7.5AA to CDP, close to 1:4, supports the conclusion that both adamantane and benzoindole groups can be encapsulated by cyclodextrin. We hope this explanation clarifies the intent of the schematic and the experimental evidence underlying the interactions depicted.\nRegarding Figures 2J and 2K, we appreciate you bringing attention to the inconsistency in the numerical increments on the x-axes. These graphs were designed to illustrate the trend of fluorescence intensity across the corresponding organs, rather than to emphasize precise numerical increments. For the last two data points, we included values from extended observation times to demonstrate that no significant changes occur beyond the initial time points, thereby highlighting the stability of the trend after prolonged observation.'}]",pubpeer,"```markdown
1. **Schematic Diagram Misrepresentation**: The schematic diagram of the cyanine dye structure in Figure 1 could mislead readers. Specifically:
   - The indole benzene ring is depicted as being connected to the red polygon via a blue flexible linker, whereas it should be directly attached to the red polygon.
   - The indole benzene ring is drawn in a similar style to adamantane, which could cause confusion about their binding characteristics.

2. **Inconsistent X-Axis Increments**: In Figures 2J and 2K, although the x-axis intervals are equal, the numerical increments are inconsistent, particularly in the last two values. This inconsistency could impact clarity regarding the trends illustrated by the fluorescence intensity data across different organs.

1. **Identical EDX Spectra for Different Materials:**
   - The two EDX spectra presented in Figure 10 are identical despite claiming to represent different materials. This is concerning given that the materials undergo different processes (as-deposited vs. annealed), which should have resulted in different elemental abundance quantifications.

2. **Unusually Noiseless and Sharp Spectra Peaks:**
   - The spectra peaks appear unusually smooth and sharp, lacking the typical noise seen in raw spectral data. This suggests a potential issue with how the data was processed or presented.

3. **Repetitive Noise in Specific Energy Ranges:**
   - There is a noticeable repetitive noise in both spectra within the energy ranges of 2 to 8 keV and 8.5 to 9.5 keV, which is unexpected given the supposed differences in materials and conditions.

4. **Use of Image Files for EDS Data:**
   - The EDS data was originally obtained as image files. The process involved extracting peak positions from these images and plotting the spectrum, which inherently smoothed out the noise typically present in raw data.

5. **Previous Use of Unusual Spectra:**
   - The same unusual spectra has been used in another article by the same authors, raising further concerns about the consistency and accuracy of data representation across different works.

1. The panels in Figure 11 appear very similar, differing only in shading, which raises concerns about whether they truly represent distinct experimental conditions.

2. There was a pasting error in Figure 11, where the image for GP1-2-Ca2+ (pH=8) at 6 hours was incorrectly replaced with the same image as GP1-2-Ca2+ (pH=9) at 6 hours. This error led to a duplication of experimental images for different conditions.

3. As a result of the error, the actual experimental data for GP1-2-Ca2+ (pH=8) at 6 hours was not represented, although the analysis had no issues.

4. The authors have acknowledged these errors and have made corrections by re-splicing the correct image for GP1-2-Ca2+ (pH=8) at 6 hours and have contacted the journal editor to make amendments to the manuscript.

5. The original data images for the GP1-2-Ca2+ (pH=8) 6-hour scratch experiment were repeated three times to validate the experimental results.

However, the novelty of our work lies not in the synthesis of new materials but in the application of machine learning to predict their performance as X-ray scintillators.

Our model was trained on a large dataset from crystallographic databases (excluding the five materials), and the predictions were validated using experimentally synthesized materials, demonstrating the accuracy of our approach.\nDataset Accessibility and Model Reproducibility:\nOur dataset is derived from both experimental measurements and publicly available crystallographic databases. The single-crystal structure of [TEA]₂MnI₄ has been determined and will be uploaded to the CCDC database for validation and reference.

1. The authors reported examining mitochondria-lysosome contacts using Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC). However, there is a discrepancy in the experimental setup where the GFP-11 tag on LAMP1 should face the lysosomal lumen, potentially placing the split-GFP portions in different compartments. This raises questions about the origin of the BiFC signal described in the paper, as it was attributed to contact on the cytosolic face.

2. An error was identified in the publication regarding the construct used in the experiments. Specifically, the GFP-11 tag was actually fused to the c-terminal of LAMP1, which contradicts what was depicted in Figure 5F of the paper. The published cartoon mistakenly suggested otherwise. Though the experiment was conducted correctly, this error requires correction in the published figures.

All mice were 28 weeks old at the time of death. So 12 weeks refers to CDCA and INT747 treatment.

1. **Image Duplication in Figure 6**: There is a potential duplication of images in Figure 6, with the same image mistakenly used for both the CTL group and the HFD+CDCA group.

2. **Inconsistent Descriptions of Treatment Durations**: The abstract and methods section contain conflicting information regarding the duration of the high-fat diet treatment for mice. The abstract mentions a 20-week treatment, whereas the methods imply that treatment for the CDCA and INT-747 was for 12 weeks.

3. **Request for Original Blot Scans**: The uncropped, original blot scans or films were requested for transparency and verification.

4. **Inconsistent Contrast in Figure 7CD**: The DAPI-stained panels in Figure 7CD show different contrast settings between the left and right images, which makes the images difficult to compare accurately.

5. **Image Mapping Error Confirmation**: The authors confirmed the image duplication error in Figure 6 due to negligence during the mapping process. This error was acknowledged, and the authors have contacted the publisher to address it with an erratum.

6. **Treatment Duration Clarification**: Clarification was provided for the treatment process and timing: 5-week-old mice were acquired, adapted for 3 weeks, and then underwent a 20-week high-fat diet and 12-week CDCA and INT-747 intervention.

7. **Supplementary Data for Original Blots**: The authors indicated that original blot data has already been shared as supplementary material and are willing to provide it again if needed.

8. **Contrast Consistency Explanation**: The authors confirmed that all images were taken under the same exposure and contrast settings, attributing variations to antigen degradation over time, which might have affected fluorescence intensities.

# Errors Summary

1. **Inappropriate Terminology:**
   - Non-standard terms like ""Parkinson’s illness,"" ""Parkinson’s infection,"" and ""Parkinson’s sickness"" used instead of ""Parkinson’s disease.""
   - Incorrect jargon such as ""10-overlay cross-approval"" instead of ""10-fold cross-validation"".

2. **Use of Tortured Phrases:**
   - Phrases likely altered by paraphrasing software to avoid plagiarism, leading to readability issues, e.g., ""administered AI"" instead of ""supervised artificial intelligence.""

3. **Incorrect References and Citations:**
   - Multiple instances of irrelevant citations, such as:
     - Citation for ""a sound speech issue"" statement is irrelevant to Parkinson’s disease.
     - Irrelevant references for statements regarding neurology treatment.

4. **Misleading Literature Review:**
   - Content appears paraphrased from reference texts not matching the cited study. For instance, description from reference [17] actually matches another paper's study.

   - Figure 20 matches an earlier paper's figure, suggesting potential duplication.
   - Figures supposedly representing the same datasets across papers exhibit identical imagery and results.

6. **Table Discrepancies:**
   - Mismatched F-scores in Table 5 not aligning with precision and recall values, unlike expected from the harmonic mean relationship.

7. **Incorrect Software Mention:**
   - Originally stated use of Python for analysis, contradicted by subsequent correction indicating use of IBM SPSS Modeler.

8. **Lack of Clarity and Structure:**
   - Literature review composes one long paragraph, impacting readability.
   - Other tortured phrases include ""monetarily accessible"" (commercially available) and ""casing of the film"" (frame of the video).

9. **Questionable Results:**
   - Identical neural network performance data across papers noticed despite different contexts, raising authenticity concerns.

1. Contradictory Statement on Lipid Compounds:
   - The paper includes a contradictory statement that ""A lack of C16:0 ceramide and C24:0 phosphatidylcholine inhibits brain development in vivo,"" contradicting the original article by Honda et al. (2023). The original article states that ""Application of C24:0 ceramide, but not C16:0 ceramide or C24:0 phosphatidylcholine, to GPSN2+/- neurons rescues both neuronal polarity determination and lipid-raft density in the growth cone."" 

2. Suggestion for Clarity on Ceramide Roles:
   - It is suggested that the paper should clarify the roles of ceramide, particularly by adding references discussing ceramide synthetase 6 and its deficiency's impact on micromorphological brain abnormalities and behavioral disorders in mice.

3. Mitochondrial Function and Development:
   - The role of C16:0 ceramide in regulating mitochondrial function during early fetal development and the cessation post-birth should be highlighted more clearly, as it is necessary for proper understanding.

4. Suggested Rewriting for Clarity:
   - The statement ""A lack of C16:0 ceramide and C24:0 phosphatidylcholine inhibits brain development in vivo."" should be rewritten to provide clarity, such as ""A lack of C16:0 ceramide and C24:0 phosphatidylcholine affects normal brain development."" Citing relevant works (Bernal-Vega et al., 2023; Pant and Aguilera-Albesa, 2020) for additional context is recommended.

1. **Figure Duplication Error**: The image of BD24 was erroneously used in both BD24 and BD27.

2. **Compound Number Confusion**: During the renaming process from BD1-BD30 to BD1-BD27, three compounds (BD9, BD10, and BD11) were removed due to low percentage purity, which caused confusion in understanding which compounds were being referred to in the study.

3. **Inconsistent Compound References**: Inconsistencies were noted in multiple sections such as ""In vitro Aβ aggregation assay,"" ""structure activity relationship (SAR) study,"" ""solubility,"" and ""cell viability,"" where BD24 was mentioned inappropriately after the renaming adjustment.

4. **Incorrect Compound Codes**: The authors revised the compound numbering by subtracting three from their original codes, which led to previous code numbers being used inappropriately in the publication materials.

5. **Repeat Mistake in Figure**: In the supplementary materials, specifically in Figure S2, a mistake occurred as the micrograph of the new BD24 was used in both the BD24 (correct position) and the new BD27 (which incorrectly resembles the previous code of BD24).

6. **NMR Spectroscopy Error**: For the BD17 compound, the 13C NMR figure was duplicated instead of including the 1H NMR figure, which had to be corrected.

7. **Potential Data Discrepancy in Analysis**: Due to these inconsistencies and errors, there is confusion about the data used, although the authors have assured that further analysis was done on the corrected list of compounds (BD01-BD28) and reported in the manuscript.

This is of course a very unrealistic assumption. It is well known that Eq.

1. The authors incorrectly used and interpreted the double log Stern–Volmer equation to determine the association constant (Ka) and the number of binding sites (n), citing a paper that explicitly rejects this usage.

2. The study assumed the formation of a non-fluorescent complex and equated [L]a with [L]free, leading to potential erroneous values for even simple 1:1 binding.

3. The double log equation linearizes non-linear data, potentially giving a false impression of a good correlation.

4. The equation is essentially a linearization of the Hill equation, which only accurately yields binding stoichiometry under the assumption of ""infinite"" cooperativity—an unrealistic scenario.

5. The authors’ manuscript incorrectly cited the critic’s paper as supporting their use of the double log Stern–Volmer equation when it should not have been cited for that purpose.

1. **Notational and Theoretical Errors:**
   - Repeated notational errors in equations, specifically the transition from `(y,x)` to `(-y,-x)`.
   - Several comments point out that these might be perceived as notational errors, not theoretical errors. However, the repetition indicates a lack of clarity or consistency in notation.

2. **Logical and Semantic Misunderstandings:**
   - Equation `(3)` is described as being ""nonsense"" due to its unconventional interpretation of logic involving `(0,1)`. This suggests a misalignment between the presented logic and conventional logic systems.
   - Misapplication or misunderstanding of conjunctions and how they are typically applied in fuzzy set theory.

3. **Set Inclusion Relations:**
   - The set inclusion relation cannot theoretically or logically hold for both `≤` and `≥`, and this has been pointed out as an error by several commenters.
   - Inconsistencies in the application of set inclusion using bipolar values and acknowledged logical theory.

4. **Proofs and Fabrication Issues:**
   - Theorem 1 is stated without a proof, raising suspicions of its validity. Commenters claim that the omission of this proof suggests a fabrication issue since no proof is provided or accessible.

5. **Mathematical and Lattice Misunderstanding:**
   - Misunderstanding of basic concepts regarding lattice and logic, particularly the differentiation or equivalence between `[−1,0]×[0,+1]` and separate intervals `[−1,0]` and `[0,1]`.

6. **Terminology and Language Use:**
   - Abuse of terms such as ""nonsense"" in response to logical inconsistencies, indicating a possible underestimation of semantic and theoretical nuance.
   - Accusations of damaging discourse and platform credibility through unfounded claims or misunderstandings.

7. **Clarity and Consistency in Presentation:**
   - Overall, there is a recurring theme regarding the lack of clarity and consistency in both the logic and presentation of the paper’s arguments and claims.
   - Encouragements and requests for corrections underline the need for clear, logical explanations and accurate, consistent use of notation.

1. **Incorrect Terminology**: 
   - Non-standard terms such as ""Parkinson's illness"", ""Parkinson's infection"", and ""Parkinson's sickness"" were used instead of the correct term ""Parkinson's disease"".
   - Terms like ""10-overlay cross-approval"", ""long-transient memory"", ""irregular backwoods"", and ""multi-facet perceptron"" were used instead of ""10-fold cross-validation"", ""long short-term memory"", ""random forest"", and ""multi-layer perceptron"" respectively.

2. **Usage of Tortured Phrases**:
   - Phrases appeared to be paraphrased awkwardly, such as ""monetarily accessible"" instead of ""commercially available"" and ""seriousness assessment"" instead of ""severity rating"".

3. **Software Implementation Errors**:
   - Misreporting of software; the models and analysis were implemented using IBM SPSS Modeler, not Python.

4. **Spurious and Irrelevant Citations**:
   - Several references cited were found to be unrelated to the statements made in the paper. Examples include citations irrelevant to Parkinson's disease or the mentioned topic.

5. **Paraphrasing from Source Texts**:
   - The literature review appeared to be poorly paraphrased from source papers, closely mirroring their wording and structure without accurate referencing.

6. **Figures**:
   - Figure 20 was reportedly identical to a figure (Figure 11) from the earlier published paper ""A Novel Approach Using Learning Algorithm for Parkinson’s Disease Detection with Handwritten Sketches"" (2023).
   - Similarities between Figure 9 of this paper and Figure 5 of an earlier paper were noted, but they represented standard correlations from a public dataset.

7. **Incorrect Table Data**:
   - The F-scores presented in Table 5 did not align correctly with the listed precision and recall values, suggesting computational errors that couldn't be explained by rounding.

8. **Flow and Structure Issues**:
   - The literature review was presented as one continuous multi-page paragraph, which is not standard practice and affects clarity and readability.

# Summary of Errors

1. **Inconsistent Terminology**:
   - Non-standard terms such as ""Parkinson’s illness"", ""Parkison’s infection"", and ""Parkinson’s sickness"" were used instead of the standardized ""Parkinson’s disease"".
   - Use of terms like ""10-overlay cross-approval"", ""administered AI"", ""approval precision"", ""backwood classifier"" instead of established scientific terms like ""10-fold cross-validation"", ""supervised artificial intelligence"", ""accuracy"", and ""random forest classifier"".

2. **Tortured Phrases**:
   - Over-complicated, paraphrased language resulted in phrases such as ""monetarily accessible"" instead of ""commercially available"", ""seriousness assessment"" instead of ""severity rating"", and ""casing of the film"" instead of ""frame of the video"".

3. **Incorrect Software Mention**:
   - Misrepresentations regarding the software used: IBM SPSS Modeler was used instead of Python as originally stated.

4. **Irrelevant References**:
   - Numerous statements were followed by citations that did not relate to the content, like irrelevant references being cited for speech and language screening, practical treatment approaches, and medication dosage predictions.

5. **Literature Review Issues**:
   - The literature review appeared to be paraphrased or directly copied from the source without proper citation, specifically replicating a study description that matched another referenced work.
   - The literature review was written as an unbroken multi-page paragraph, making it harder to read.

6. **Duplicate Images and Results**:
   - Figure 20 and another figure from the paper feature the same images as figures from an earlier paper, suggesting potential data duplication.
   - Identical performance results for neural networks were reported between this and an earlier paper.

7. **Inconsistent F-scores**:
   - F-scores listed in Table 5 did not correlate with the provided precision and recall values, violating the principle that F-score lies between precision and recall.

8. **Proofreading and Editing Oversight**:
   - The article contained issues that should have been caught during proofreading by coauthors, editors, and other reviewing parties, calling into question the rigour of the publication process.

9. **Unexplained Deviations from Standard Phrasing**:
   - The paper contained numerous paraphrased phrases without clear rationale, suggesting an attempt to evade plagiarism detection.

1. The argument in the last paragraph of the proof of Theorem 1.1 is faulty. Specifically, when extending a non-trivial automorphism of L to the entire group by fixing any element of a maximal independent subset Y of U, the automorphism is incorrectly redefined for the elements of L that are generated by Y.
