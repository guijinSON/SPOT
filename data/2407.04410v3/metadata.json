      "text": "**Abstract.** In the general setting of a locally compact Abelian group \\( G \\), the Delsarte extremal problem asks for the supremum of integrals over the collection of continuous positive definite functions \\( f : G \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) satisfying \\( f(0) = 1 \\) and having \\( \\operatorname{supp} f_+ \\subset \\Omega \\) for some measurable subset \\( \\Omega \\) of finite measure. In this paper, we consider the question of the existence of an extremal function for the Delsarte extremal problem. In particular, we show that there exists an extremal function for the Delsarte problem when \\( \\Omega \\) is closed, extending previously known existence results to a larger class of functions.\n\nThe Delsarte problem arose first in the context of discrete codes. Specifically, in [8], P. Delsarte found an upper bound for the number of code words in codes satisfying some prescribed distance condition. The solution was carried out in terms of Krawtchouk polynomials and the MacWilliams transform. Subsequently, in [9], P. Delsarte, J. M. Goethals, and J. J. Seidel considered another instance of the Delsarte problem in the context of spherical codes in \\( \\mathbb{R}^d \\). In particular, they derived an upper bound for certain spherical codes in terms of coefficients of Gegenbauer expansions. Various instances of the Delsarte problem occur in the context of coding theory, see for instance [18] and the references within. It appears in the context of sphere packing where it is used to obtain upper bounds for the density of sphere packings, see [1,2,4,11,12,14–16,19]. For more on the Delsarte problem and its generalisation to locally compact Abelian (LCA) groups, see [3]. Based on the Poisson summation formula, in [6], H. Cohn and N. Elkies use the Delsarte scheme to show that the sphere packing density is bounded above\n\nDepartment of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, University of Cape Town,  \nPrivate Bag X1, 7701, Rondebosch, Cape Town, South Africa  \ne-mail: rmbmit001@myuct.ac.za\n\n(Received March 1, 2024; revised November 18, 2024; accepted November 18, 2024)"

So, the problem of the existence of an extremal function for the Delsarte problem seems interesting. In this direction, in [3, 10] the problem of the existence of an extremal function for a Delsarte-type extremal problem is considered for the Gorbachev class, defined as follows.

Let \\( C(G) \\) be the space of continuous functions on \\( G \\) to the complex numbers and put on it the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets. The dual group \\( \\widehat{G} \\) of \\( G \\) consists of continuous homomorphisms of \\( G \\) to the multiplicative group \\( \\mathbb{T} = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| = 1 \\} \\).\nWith respect to pointwise operations and the subspace topology that it inherits as a subset of \\( C(G) \\), \\( \\widehat{G} \\) is a LCA group. Fix a Haar measure \\( \\lambda_G \\) on \\( G \\) and let \\( L^1(G) \\) denote the usual Banach space of integrable complex-valued functions on \\( G \\). The Fourier transform of \\( f \\in L^1(G) \\) is defined by\n\n\\[\n\\widehat{f}(\\chi) := \\int_G f(g)\\overline{\\chi(g)}\\, d\\lambda_G(g) \\quad \\text{for all } \\chi \\in \\widehat{G}.\n\\]\n\nThe convolution \\( f * g \\) of functions \\( f, g : G \\to \\mathbb{C} \\) is defined by\n\n\\[\nf * g(x) := \\int_G f(y)g(x-y)\\, d\\lambda_G(y) \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in G,\n\\]\n\nwhenever the integral exists. A function \\( f : G \\to \\mathbb{C} \\) is positive definite if the inequality\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n c_i \\overline{c_j} f(g_i - g_j) \\geq 0\n\\]\n\nholds for all choices of \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N},\\, c_i \\in \\mathbb{C}, \\) and \\( g_i \\in G \\). It is a consequence of Bochner's theorem that the Fourier transform of an integrable continuous positive definite function is nonnegative. Consequently, since \\( 0 \\leq \\widehat{f}(0) = \\int_G f(g)\\, d\\lambda_G(g) \\), it follows that the integral of an integrable continuous positive definite function is nonnegative. Let \\( P(G) \\subset C(G) \\) denote the collection of continuous positive definite functions on the group \\( G \\). Define \\( P_1(G) := \\{ f \\in P(G) : f(0) = 1 \\} \\).

According to [17, Theorem 1.7.3] an integrally positive definite function agrees locally almost everywhere with a continuous positive definite function. When \\( G \\) is \\( \\sigma \\)-compact, locally almost everywhere is the same as almost everywhere. Therefore, on a \\( \\sigma \\)-compact group an integrally positive definite function agrees almost everywhere with a continuous positive definite function. The approach to the main problem of this paper is to reduce the problem to the case of \\( \\sigma \\)-compact LCA groups and then extend the solution to the general case. Recall that a LCA group \\( G \\) is \\( \\sigma \\)-compact if it can be written as a countable union of compact sets.\n\nIn this section, we show the existence of an extremal function for the Delsarte extremal problem. Our approach follows that of [10].

Now, \\( \\tilde{\\varphi} \\) is continuous at all \\( g \\in H \\) because it coincides with the continuous function \\( \\varphi : H \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\) on the open set \\( H \\). It is continuous at all \\( g \\in G \\setminus H \\) because it is identically 0 on the open set \\( G \\setminus H \\).

By outer regularity of the Haar measure on G, there is an open identity neighbourhood U in G containing Ω with \\( \\lambda_G(U) < \\infty \\). We claim that U lies in an open σ-compact subgroup. To see this, let K be some σ-compact open subgroup of G.

Now, note that G is a disjoint union of cosets g + K of K with g running through a set of coset representatives of K. Since the cosets of K are disjoint and cover G, the collection of subsets (g + K) ∩ U of U as g runs through the set of coset representatives of K are disjoint and their union is U. Now, either (g + K) ∩ U = ∅ or \\( \\lambda_G((g + K) \\cap U) > 0 \\) because (g + K) ∩ U is open, and every open set is either empty or has strictly positive measure. Hence (g + K) ∩ U ≠ ∅ for at most countably many cosets g + K of K, otherwise this would contradict the finiteness of the Haar measure of U. Clearly, U is contained in the subgroup generated by the union of K and the at most countably many open σ-compact cosets g + K of K that meet U nontrivially.

Then for any $n > N$, we have\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\int_G h_n(g) d\\lambda_G(g) - D_G(\\Omega) \\right| \\leq \\sum_{k=n}^{\\infty} c_k^n \\left| \\int_G f_k(g) d\\lambda_G(g) - D_G(\\Omega) \\right| < \\sum_{k=n}^{\\infty} c_k^n \\varepsilon = \\varepsilon.\n\\]\n\nTherefore $(h_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is $D_G(\\Omega)$-extremal. So, replacing, if necessary, the sequence $(f_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ by this new sequence $(h_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$, assume that $(f_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ converges to $f$ strongly in $L^2(G)$. By passing to a pointwise almost everywhere convergent subsequence, assume that $(f_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ converges to $f$ pointwise almost everywhere. The fact that $|f_n(g)| \\leq 1$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $g \\in G$, and that $(f_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ converges almost everywhere to $f$ implies that $f$ is bounded in $L^{\\infty}(G)$ by 1.\n\nSince $(f_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ converges weakly in $L^2(G)$ to $f$, it follows that $f$ is integrally positive definite. The function $f$ being integrally positive definite and $G$ being $\\sigma$-compact implies that $f$ agrees almost everywhere with a continuous positive definite function. Thus, by correcting $f$ on a set of Haar measure zero, thus not changing the value of its integral, assume that $f$ is a continuous positive definite function. Continuity of $f$ and the fact that $f$ is a pointwise almost everywhere limit of the functions $f_n$, each of which satisfying $\\operatorname{supp}(f_n)_+ \\subset \\Omega$, implies that $\\operatorname{supp} f_+ \\subset \\Omega$. Since $\\operatorname{supp} f_+ \\subset \\Omega$ we have\n\n\\[\n(5) \\quad \\int_G f_+(g) d\\lambda_G(g) = \\int_{\\Omega} f_+(g) d\\lambda_G(g) \\leq \\lambda_G(\\Omega) < \\infty.\n\\]"

Therefore, f(0) = 1 and hence f ∈ 𝒢_G(Ω). Note that this also shows that f is extremal. Finally, since (f_n)_{n∈ℕ} converges to f weakly in L²(G) and lim_{n→∞} f_n(0) = f(0), Theorem 6 implies that (f_n)_{n∈ℕ} converges to f uniformly on the compact subsets of G. □\n\nNow, having secured the existence of an extremal function for σ-compact groups, we extend the solution to general LCA groups to prove our main result.\n\nTHEOREM 9. Let G be a LCA group and Ω a closed neighbourhood of 0 with finite Haar measure. There exists an extremal function for D_G(Ω). Moreover, the extremal function can be approximated uniformly on the compact subsets of G by a D_G(Ω)-extremal sequence.\n\nPROOF. On account of Theorem 3, let H be an open σ-compact subgroup of G containing Ω such that D_G(Ω) = D_H(Ω).
