We study three possible definitions of the notion of CR functions at CR singular points, their extension to a fixed-neighborhood of the singular point, and analogues of the Baouendi–Trèves approximation in a fixed neighborhood. In particular, we give a construction of certain disc hulls, which, if large enough, give the fixed-neighborhood extension and approximation properties. We provide many examples showing the distinctions between the classes and the various properties studied.\n\nLet \\( M \\subset \\mathbb{C}^n \\) be a real submanifold and \\( T_{\\eta}^{0,1}M \\) the span of the antiholomorphic vectors at a point \\( \\eta \\in M \\). The manifold \\( M \\) is said to be CR at \\( q \\) if the dimension of \\( T_{\\eta}^{0,1}M \\) is constant near \\( q \\). A natural generalization of holomorphic functions is a so-called CR function, a function killed by \\( T^{0,1}M \\) vector fields. If \\( M \\) and \\( f \\) are CR and real-analytic, then \\( f \\) extends locally to a neighborhood as a holomorphic function by the theorem of Severi [20]. If the regularity is lower, we do not always get such an extension, but basic questions of when and into what set extension holds are relatively well-understood: see the pioneering work by Lewy [15], Kohn–Rossi [9], Tumanov [21], and many others. The problem then is to understand the CR singular setting. In particular, it is not immediately clear what is the most natural notion of CR function. One possible definition is simply to consider functions that are CR at CR points, or equivalently, those that are killed by vector fields valued in \\( T_{\\eta}^{0,1}M \\) at each point. We call these CR functions, and the authors have studied their extension properties in [10, 11, 13].\n\nA related question is the approximation of functions by polynomials or entire functions. In the totally real case, see Hörmander–Wermer [7], Harvey–Wells [5, 6], and in general the survey article by Dwilewicz [3]. The celebrated Baouendi–Trèves theorem [2] applied to CR functions on CR manifolds says that CR functions can be approximated in a fixed neighborhood (not depending on the function) of any point by holomorphic polynomials. At CR singular points, such a theorem does not necessarily hold for the CR functions as we defined them above. We therefore define the class of CR\\(_P\\) functions to be those that are locally uniform limits of holomorphic polynomials. Mondal [18], extending the work of Mergelyan [16] and Minsker [17], recently studied the approximation property for continuous functions on certain CR singular manifolds that are totally real at CR points. Finally, we write CR\\(_H\\) for functions that are restrictions of holomorphic functions, that is, those that do"

Sometimes \\( \\mathcal{O} \\) is used for such functions, but we will reserve \\( \\mathcal{O}(U) \\) for functions holomorphic on a specific open set \\( U \\) for clarity. See Section 2 for precise definitions and the statement of one of our main results.\n\nThere are other possible definitions for what constitutes CR functions on a CR singular manifold. For example, Nacinovich–Porten [19] define a class of functions by considering the local closure of germs of \\( \\text{CR}_H \\) functions, and they study its extension properties. Their definition is equivalent to iterating (possibly infinitely many times) an approximation procedure, and hence this class lies in between our \\( \\text{CR}_H \\) and \\( \\text{CR}_P \\).\n\nA subtle but important issue with respect to extension and approximation of CR functions is the size of the neighborhood, namely, whether the neighborhood to which the function extends, or on which it is approximated, depends on the function itself (or not, as is the case for Baouendi–Trèves). For this purpose, we define four different properties a class of functions can satisfy: the extension property and approximation property for functions that extend to be holomorphic to a neighborhood and those that are approximable locally uniformly by holomorphic polynomials, and the fixed-neighborhood extension property and the fixed-neighborhood approximation property if extension or approximation can be done in a neighborhood independent of the function. The extension property implies the approximation property, but not vice-versa. See Section 3 for the definitions and basic examples.\n\nOne can use families of discs to extend \\( \\text{CR}_P \\) functions. If we can fill a neighborhood of a point with analytic discs attached to the submanifold, possibly iterating this construction, we can extend \\( \\text{CR}_P \\) functions to this neighborhood. A subtle issue is that we need these discs to be attached to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a point, that is, we do not a priori have the fixed-neighborhood approximation property for \\( \\text{CR}_P \\) functions at a CR singular point. We formalize this property in Definition 3.2 and define what we call the DH condition.\n\nIf we can further shrink such discs to a point, we can apply the Kontinuitätssatz (see Ivashkovich [8]) to get analytic continuation of \\( \\text{CR}_H \\) functions, that is, functions holomorphic in some neighborhood, and we can hope to get a fixed-neighborhood extension property. However, showing that these continuations are single-valued is difficult. For points in the shrinking approximate disc hull, or \\( \\text{SADH}_q \\), we can shrink these discs nicely to the point \\( q \\). Here we require only approximately attached discs. If \\( \\text{SADH}_q \\) contains a neighborhood of the point \\( q \\), then we get the fixed-neighborhood extension property (see Corollary 4.4). However, if one requires iteration, much more care has to be taken. We must require the resulting paths in the iteration not to intersect, so we define the iterated SADH condition in Definition 3.4. With this condition, we obtain the fixed-neighborhood extension property in Theorem 4.5.\n\nThese ideas can be combined in many different ways with existing results such as the theorem of Hanges and Trèves on the propagation of extension along complex analytic curves through CR points. See Section 4 for these results. In the CR singular case, a large disc hull and in fact the strong iterated SADH condition can appear even in the Levi-flat case, where near the CR points all discs lie in the manifold. In Section 8, we show that the manifold given by \\( w = \\overline{z}_1 z_2 \\), which is Levi-flat at CR points (in fact, an image of \\( \\mathbb{R}^2 \\times \\mathbb{C} \\)), nevertheless satisfies the strong iterated SADH condition at the origin.\n\nWe are interested in producing examples showing that the given classes of functions are distinct. In particular, we wish to extend the Baouendi–Trèves result to a more general CR singular setting. A natural question is whether a class of CR functions on a submanifold of"

In this setting, one may guess that the independence of the holomorphic and real coordinates may be used in tandem and that an approximation theorem holds as long as it holds whenever the last coordinate is fixed. That is, perhaps one can combine the classical Weierstrass theorem with Mergelyan’s theorem. It turns out (see Theorem 4.12) that such a result holds with an additional hypothesis. This result shows that fixed-neighborhood extension is not necessary for fixed-neighborhood approximation (see, for example, Section 9). With such a result, one can prove approximation results for flat hyperbolic Bishop surfaces (see Section 7). For flat elliptic Bishop surfaces, in Section 5 we prove approximation under the extra assumption of extension to the natural family of attached analytic discs. For the special elliptic Bishop surface w = |z|², we can adapt the proof of Baouendi–Trèves for the approximation and obtain a linear operator via integration. See Section 6.\n\nLet M ⊂ Cⁿ be a real submanifold of regularity at least C¹. We will assume that all submanifolds are embedded. A point q ∈ M is called a CR point if the dimension of\n\nT_η^{0,1} M = C ⊗ T_η M ∩ span_C { ∂/∂ż₁|_η, ..., ∂/∂ż_n|_η }    (1)\n\nis constant as a function of η in some neighborhood of q. Write M_CR ⊂ M for the set of CR points. A point q ∈ M is said to be a CR singular point if q ∉ M_CR. A submanifold is said to be CR if it has no CR singular points, or in other words if M = M_CR. A vector field L ∈ Γ(C⊗TM) is said to be a CR vector field if L_q ∈ T_q^{0,1} M for all q ∈ M. We remark that our definition of CR vector field includes vector fields at CR singular points as well.\n\nThere are several natural definitions of what it means for a function to be CR on a possibly CR singular submanifold. That is, there are different ways to define the analogue of holomorphic functions on a real submanifold. We focus on three such definitions.\n\nDefinition 2.1. Suppose M ⊂ Cⁿ is a real C¹ submanifold and f : M → C is a continuous function. We say:\n\n(i) f is a CR function if Lf = 0 for every (continuous) CR vector field L on M, interpreted in terms of distributions if f is only continuous.\n\n(ii) f is a CR_P function if for every q ∈ M there exist a compact neighborhood K ⊂ M of q and a sequence of holomorphic polynomials {P_j} such that P_j converges uniformly on K to f|_K.\n\n(iii) f is a CR_H function if for every q ∈ M there exist a neighborhood U ⊂ Cⁿ of q and a holomorphic function F : U → C such that F|_{M∩U} = f|_{M∩U}.\n\nWe write CR^k(M) for the set of CR functions that are in C^k(M), including k = 0 for continuous, k = ∞ for smooth, and k = ω for real-analytic. We define CR_P^k(M) in a similar way. As CR_H functions are always of the same regularity as the manifold, we will write simply CR_H(M).\n\nRemark 2.2. The class CR_H(M) makes sense for any set M, not necessarily a manifold. Correspondingly, some of the basic results in this paper hold without M necessarily being a manifold. Similarly the classes CR_P^k(M) also make sense for a non-manifold M, although the regularity of the functions then needs to be understood, for example, in the sense of Whitney. We leave such generalizations to the reader."

We remark that if \\( f \\) is a \\( CR_P \\) function, then \\( Lf = 0 \\) in the sense of distributions for every CR vector field \\( L \\), and hence \\( f \\) is CR.

In fact, \\( CR_H \\) implies \\( CR_P \\) because we can use a series expansion at each point.\n\nWhen \\( M \\) is real-analytic and CR, by Severi’s theorem [20] real-analytic CR functions are restrictions of holomorphic functions. That is, in this case \\( CR^\\omega(M) = CR^\\omega_P(M) = CR_H(M) \\). On the other hand, there do exist smooth CR functions on CR submanifolds that are not restrictions of holomorphic functions. In the presence of CR singularities, these classes can be distinct even in the real-analytic case.\n\nFor CR submanifolds of class \\( C^2 \\), the first two definitions are equivalent, which follows from the Baouendi–Trèves approximation theorem [2]: If \\( M \\) is a CR submanifold of class \\( C^2 \\) and \\( q \\in M \\), then there exists a compact neighborhood \\( K \\subset M \\) of \\( q \\) such that for every CR function \\( f \\) on \\( M \\) there exists a sequence \\( \\{P_j\\} \\) of holomorphic polynomials converging uniformly on \\( K \\) to \\( f|_K \\).

For some sets, we may also have to iterate this procedure, as Example 3.13 shows. Some of the following definitions and examples are stated for an arbitrary set X rather than a submanifold. The reason is that if we iterate the given constructions, we will obtain sets that are not necessarily submanifolds in the intermediate steps.\n\nWe make some immediate observations: CR_H(M) always has the extension property and CR^k_P(M) always has the approximation property. The fixed-neighborhood extension property for a class at a point implies the fixed-neighborhood approximation property for that class at that point. If CR^k(M) has the fixed-neighborhood approximation property, then CR^k(M) = CR^k_P(M). These properties are invariant under holomorphic changes of coordinates. If M is contained in the Levi-flat hypersurface given by Im z_n = 0, then CR_H(M) does not have the fixed-neighborhood extension property as 1/(z_n - iε) is in CR_H(M) for all real ε ≠ 0.\n\nNote that the fixed-neighborhood approximation property for CR_H(M) need not imply the fixed-neighborhood extension property for CR_H(M).

We wish to apply the Kontinuitätssatz to functions defined on a neighborhood of X, and for this purpose we also need to be able to continuously shrink these discs. It is not always possible to shrink the discs that make up the disc hull even if X is a submanifold (see the examples below), so we require another definition. On the other hand, we do not need to exactly attach these discs, as we only need their boundaries to be near X to apply the Kontinuitätssatz to functions in CR_H.

It is possible to extend functions in CR_H(X) to a ball in SADH_q(X) if it in fact contains such a ball, but it is not possible simply to iterate this procedure. That is, just because SADH_q(SADH_q(X)) contains a ball does not mean we can extend to this ball—we need extra assumptions. One possible way to do this is to ensure that the paths along which we can extend do not create loops. With an eye towards the application to weighted homogeneous submanifolds, and specifically the example in Theorem 8.1, we make the following definition, which will allow iterating the shrinking disc hulls.\n\nDefinition 3.4. We say Y is a union of a compact family of nonintersecting paths from SADH_q(X) if there is a family 𝒴 of paths ψ(t) = φ_t(0) arising from the definition of SADH_q(X), 𝒴 is compact with respect to the uniform norm, Y is the union of the images of paths in 𝒴, and whenever ψ₁, ψ₂ ∈ 𝒴 are such that ψ₁(t₁) = ψ₂(t₂) for some t₁, t₂ > 0, then ψ₁([0, t₁]) = ψ₂([0, t₂]).\n\nWe will call the sets X₀, X₁, . . . , X_k SADH iterates at q if X₀ ⊂ X is a neighborhood of q, and each X_j for j = 1, . . . , k is a union of a compact family of nonintersecting paths from SADH_q(X_{j−1}).\n\nWe say that X satisfies the iterated SADH condition at q if X₀ = X and there are sets X₁, X₂, . . . , X_k that are SADH iterates at q and X_k contains a neighborhood of q in C^n.\n\nWe say that X satisfies the strong iterated SADH condition at q if X satisfies the iterated SADH condition at q for all neighborhoods X₀ ⊂ X of q.\n\nWe will show that if SADH_q(X) contains a ball centered at q, then functions from CR_H(X) will extend to that ball. However, it is not true that functions in CR_H(X) necessarily extend holomorphically to a neighborhood of SADH_q(X). We can use the Kontinuitätssatz, but that only gives us analytic continuation along the paths arising from the disc families, not unrestricted continuation. Without some condition on SADH_q(X) (or a subset), it is not always possible to have functions in CR_H(X) to extend to CR_H(SADH_q(X)) precisely because we do not get unrestricted continuation.

The way we defined SADH_q(X) used paths of strictly increasing distance. We get the same set if we relax this definition simply to increasing distance: If p can be reached by a family of discs where ‖φ_t(0) − q‖ is only increasing and with boundary in an (ε/2)-neighborhood of X, we can perturb the family to get a strictly increasing ‖φ_t(0) − q‖ and boundary in an ε-neighborhood of X. Assuming ‖φ_t(0) − q‖ is strictly increasing makes some of the arguments somewhat cleaner, and as we just saw, there is no loss in generality.\n\nWe will generally apply SADH_q to neighborhoods of q in a manifold. A manifold is always locally path connected and, moreover, it is (locally) a union of paths of increasing distance from q ∈ M. So if X is such a neighborhood in a manifold, then X ⊂ SADH_q(X), and SADH_q(X) is (again) a union of paths of increasing distance from q.\n\nRemark 3.7. It is easy to see that SADH_q(X) is contained in the rational hull of X: Consider any rational function f that is holomorphic in a neighborhood of X. By the Kontinuitätssatz, f analytically continues to any point of SADH_q(X), and hence SADH_q(X) does not intersect the pole set.\n\nIt is useful to know whether the hulls we define are compact if we are starting with a compact set. The set SADH_q(X) is compact if X is, but unfortunately DH(X) need not be compact. However, the polynomial hull is always compact.\n\nLemma 3.8. If X ⊂ ℂⁿ is compact, then SADH_q(X) is compact.\n\nProof. That SADH_q(X) is bounded follows from the maximum principle. To see that it is closed, suppose p₁ ∈ SADH_q(X). For any ε > 0 there is a p₂ ∈ SADH_q(X) that is within ε/2 of p₁. There is an approximately attached shrinking family of discs where the last disc goes through p₂ and the boundaries are within ε/2 of X. By adding a small function linear in t to the family, we can create a new family of discs where the last disc goes through p₁ and the boundaries are within ε of X. As ε > 0 was arbitrary, p₁ ∈ SADH_q(X). □\n\nExample 3.9. Given a compact set X, the set DH(X) need not be compact. Let φ_k : 𝔻 → ℂ, k ∈ ℕ, be a uniformly bounded sequence of analytic functions such that φ_k(0) = 0 and φ_k|_{∂𝔻} converges to a bounded function that is continuous except at the point 1 ∈ ∂𝔻. Assume also that the sequence φ_k converges on 𝔻 \\ {1} to a continuous function φ_∞ holomorphic on 𝔻. For simplicity, we could also arrange that each φ_k extends a little past the circle. It is not difficult to construct such a sequence. Define\n\nX = {z ∈ ℂ³ : z₁ ∈ ∂𝔻, z₂ = φ_k(z₁), z₃ = 1/k, k ∈ ℕ}. (5)\n\nAny disc attached to X lies in a set where z₃ is constant, and hence either z₃ = 0 or z₃ = 1/k for some k. For each k ∈ ℕ define Φ_k(ζ) = (ζ, φ_k(ζ), 1/k). The discs Φ_k are all attached to X, and their images lie in DH(X). Moreover, for k ∈ ℕ, let Ψ(ζ) = (α(ζ), β(ζ), 1/k) be an analytic disc. The image of Φ_k is a subvariety, and it is given by functions that are holomorphic a little bit past the boundary. Thus, the analytic disc Ψ takes the circle into this subvariety, and hence it takes 𝔻 into the subvariety. In other words, the image Φ_k(𝔻) gives all the points in DH(X) for z₃ = 1/k. Note that (0, 0, 1/k) ∈ DH(X).\n\nNow suppose that Ψ(ζ) = (α(ζ), β(ζ), 0) is an analytic disc. As |α(ζ)| = 1 for |ζ| = 1, we have that α is a finite Blaschke product.

If α is not constant, then for each ζ ∈ ∂D such that α(ζ) ≠ 1, we have β(ζ) = φ∞(α(ζ)): the disc is attached, and that is the only possible z₂-coordinate. In particular, we find a contradiction as this means that β is discontinuous. Therefore, there are no discs attached to X where z₃ = 0 and z₁ is not a unimodular constant. In other words, (0, 0, 0) ∉ DH(X). But (0, 0, 0) is in the closure of DH(X), so DH(X) is not closed.\n\nExample 3.10. The iterated SADH condition is not stable under perturbation. For example, consider M ⊂ ℂ³ given by Im w = |z₁|⁴ - |z₂|⁴. The standard technique of attaching discs one normally uses for a hypersurface with indefinite Levi form applies. These discs fill a neighborhood of the origin, and all shrink to the origin. (Affine linear discs suffice.) However, the perturbation M_ε given by Im w = ε(|z₁|² + |z₂|²) + |z₁|⁴ - |z₂|⁴ is strictly pseudoconvex at 0 for all ε > 0, and hence all analytic discs attached to M_ε near 0 must fall on one side of M_ε. In a similar manner, examples having higher codimension can be constructed.\n\nExample 3.11. Consider the smooth submanifold M ⊂ ℂ³ given in coordinates (z, w₁, w₂) via\n\nw₁ = |z|², w₂ = |z|² + f(|z|²)(Re z),\n\nwhere f(t) is a smooth real-valued function that is zero precisely when t = 1/n for n ∈ ℕ or t = 0. The submanifold M is of dimension 2. It has a CR singularity at the origin but is totally real at other points. Let φ(ζ) = (z(ζ), w₁(ζ), w₂(ζ)) be an analytic disc attached to M. Then w₁(ζ) and w₂(ζ) are holomorphic functions that are real-valued on ∂D, so they are constant on D̄. This means that |z(ζ)| is also constant on ∂D. If we insist that φ be nonconstant, then z itself must be nonconstant; in particular, Re z must be nonconstant on ∂D. But since |z|² + f(|z|²)(Re z) must be constant on ∂D, we have that f(|z|²) must be zero, which is true only if w₁ = |z|² = 1/n. In other words, the only nonconstant attached analytic discs to M are those in the discrete sequence of discs\n\nφₙ(ζ) = ( 1/√n ζ, 1/n, 1/n ).          (7)\n\nThis sequence does \"shrink to zero\" discretely but not continuously, so it does not give a shrinking disc hull, although these discs are in the regular disc hull DH(M). In particular, these discs cannot be used via the Kontinuitätssatz to extend CR_H functions beyond the initial neighborhood in which they are defined.\n\nExample 3.12. If we modify the preceding example by taking f to be a real-analytic function with finitely many zeros, we find a real-analytic submanifold with trivial topology (topology of a ball) that has only finitely many attached discs.\n\nExample 3.13.

Then we find that φ₂ must be constant. A similar argument applies if φ(∂𝔻) ⊂ X₂. In either case, the disc then fills in all of |z₁| ≤ 1 or |z₁| ≤ 2. That is, we find that\n\nDH(X) = {z ∈ ℂ² : |z₁| ≤ 1, |z₂| = 1, and Im z₂ ≥ 0}\n∪ {z ∈ ℂ² : |z₁| ≤ 2, |z₂| = 1, and Im z₂ ≤ 0}.   (9)\n\nIn particular, DH(X) contains the torus 𝕋² given by |z₁| = |z₂| = 1. However, DH(X) does not contain the polydisc 𝔻². It is a relatively routine computation that DH(𝕋²) = 𝔻². Hence DH(X) does not contain the unit polydisc, but DH²(X) does. Thus, iteration is necessary for some sets.\n\nThe reader may complain that X is disconnected and that the discs do not all shrink to a point. We modify the previous example as follows. Consider the set X' ⊂ ℂ³ given by\n\nX' = {z ∈ ℂ³ : |z₁| = |z₂| = Re z₃, Im z₂ ≥ 0, z₃ ∈ [0, 1]}\n∪ {z ∈ ℂ³ : |z₁| = 2 Re z₃, |z₂| = Re z₃, Im z₂ ≤ 0, z₃ ∈ [0, 1]}.   (10)\n\nBy z₃ ∈ [0, 1] we mean that z₃ is real and in the unit interval. The set X' is connected and compact. Since the third component of every analytic disc attached to X' (and hence to any disc hull) must be constant, we reduce the computation to a scaled version of the above example in ℂ². It is not hard to see that similar reasoning holds also for approximately attached discs, and moreover we find that every disc shrinks to the origin. Hence, we have a set X' for which SADH₀(X') = DH(X') and SADH₀(SADH₀(X')) = DH²(X'). In particular, if we wish to extend functions via the hull SADH₀, we must iterate: SADH₀(SADH₀(X')) ≠ SADH₀(X').\n\nExample 3.14. Let us show that a function in CR_H(X) does not necessarily uniquely extend to a holomorphic function in a neighborhood of SADH_q(X) even though it admits analytic continuation to such a neighborhood. Define X ⊂ ℂ³ by\n\nX = {z ∈ ℂ³ : z₁ = tζ, z₂ = 0, z₃ = e^{iπt}, ζ ∈ ∂𝔻, t ∈ [0, 1]}\n∪ {z ∈ ℂ³ : z₁ = 0, z₂ = tζ, z₃ = e^{-iπt}, ζ ∈ ∂𝔻, t ∈ [0, 1]}.    (11)\n\nIt is clear that the discs ζ ∈ 𝔻 → (tζ, 0, e^{iπt}) and ζ ∈ 𝔻 → (0, tζ, e^{-iπt}) are attached to X, and furthermore these give families shrinking to the point q = (0, 0, 1). It is therefore clear that SADH_q(X) contains the set\n\n{z ∈ ℂ³ : z₁ = tζ, z₂ = 0, z₃ = e^{iπt}, ζ ∈ 𝔻, t ∈ [0, 1]}\n∪ {z ∈ ℂ³ : z₁ = 0, z₂ = tζ, z₃ = e^{-iπt}, ζ ∈ 𝔻, t ∈ [0, 1]},  (12)\n\nand any function in CR_H(X) can be analytically continued along the paths given by t ∈ [0, 1] ↦ (0, 0, e^{iπt}) and t ∈ [0, 1] ↦ (0, 0, e^{-iπt}) via the Kontinuitätssatz. The point (0, 0, −1) is in SADH_q(X) but not in X. Take a branch of, say, √z₃ on some neighborhood of X (which we can do since X is simply connected, and so is some thickening of X to obtain a neighborhood). This function is in CR_H(X), but it cannot possibly extend to a CR_H function on SADH_q(X) as the continuation along the two paths given above will give a different value at (0, 0, −1)."

If M also satisfies the strong iterated SADH condition at the CR singular points, it turns out that we get the fixed-neighborhood extension and approximation properties for CR^ω_P at such points. We first need a lemma to show that the points that can be achieved by approximately attached discs are also in the polynomial hull.\n\nLemma 4.8. Suppose that X ⊂ 𝐶ⁿ is a compact set and p ∈ 𝐶ⁿ is such that, for every ϵ > 0, there exists an approximately attached analytic disc φ: 𝔻 → 𝐶ⁿ such that φ(∂𝔻) ⊂ X_ϵ and p ∈ φ(𝔻).

We require the strong SADH condition as we want discs that are attached arbitrarily near the point q.

Let M ⊂ 𝐶ⁿ be a real-analytic submanifold such that M satisfies the strong iterated SADH condition at every CR singular point of M. Then if q ∈ M is a CR singular point, M has the fixed-neighborhood extension property for CR^ω_P(M) at q, and thus the fixed-neighborhood approximation property for CR^ω_P(M) at q.\n\nProof. First we show that CR^ω_P(M) ⊂ CR_H(M). Suppose f ∈ CR^ω_P(M). At each CR point p ∈ M, f extends to a neighborhood of p as a holomorphic function because f is real-analytic. Now assume that we have the strong iterated SADH condition at p ∈ M. By Lemma 4.8 the approximately attached discs are still in the polynomial hull. Thus, given a sequence of polynomials converging uniformly on some neighborhood X₀ of p in M, we get convergence of this sequence on all the sets X_j from Definition 3.4: Use the same argument as in the proof of Theorem 4.1, but now use Lemma 4.8. Therefore, the sequence converges on a neighborhood of p in 𝐶ⁿ. Thus, f extends to a neighborhood of p. Hence, f extends to a neighborhood of each CR singular point of M. We conclude that f ∈ CR_H(M).\nNow apply Theorem 4.5 on a simply connected neighborhood of q to obtain the result. □\n\nIf one can extend CR functions in some way near CR singular points, then one can use other techniques to extend at the CR points.

Also, M is totally real away from the CR singular points.

(From this it follows that CR^k(M) = CR_p^k(M) for every k ≤ ℓ.) Throughout we write s = Re w. First we claim that, for ε > 0 small, the level sets of ρ(z, z̄) in |z| ≤ ε have a connected complement in ℂ and empty interior. This is clear if λ = 1/2, and if λ ≠ 1/2 the claim follows from the Morse lemma because the Hessian of ρ is nondegenerate at the origin. Now put K = {(z, s): |z| ≤ δ₁/2, |s| ≤ δ₂/2}, a compact neighborhood of the origin in ℂ × ℝ. Fix s ∈ ℝ for which K_s = {z ∈ ℂ: (z, s) ∈ M ∩ K} is nonempty. Then by the claim ℂ \\ K_s is connected, and K_s has empty interior. Thus, if f ∈ C^0(M) we can use Mergelyan's theorem to uniformly approximate K_s ∋ z ↦ f(z, s) by polynomials in z. This holds whenever K_s is nonempty, so we may use Theorem 4.12 (with Remark 4.13) to uniformly approximate f on M ∩ K by polynomials in (z, s). To get holomorphic polynomials on ℂ²(z, w), replace (z, s) by (z, w). This proves that C^0(M) has the fixed-neighborhood approximation property at the origin.\n\nNow we show that CR_p^ℓ(M) ≠ CR_H(M). The function f(z, w) = z̄, considered as a function on M, belongs to C^ℓ(M) = CR_p^ℓ(M). Assume for a contradiction that f can be extended to a neighborhood of the origin in ℂ² as a holomorphic function g. Then, if L is the vector field on ℂ² defined by L = ∂/∂z̄, we have Lg ≡ 0 near the origin. But L is tangent to M at the origin, and L₀f ≠ 0. This is a contradiction. □\n\nRemark 7.2. By the fixed-neighborhood approximation property for C^0(M) where M is given by w = z^2 + z̄^2, every continuous function on a compact subset of ℂ can be uniformly approximated by polynomials in z and z̄^2. This is a special case of a result due to Minsker [17] and later generalized by Mondal [18], whose work we mentioned in the introduction.\n\nIn this section we study properties of the submanifold of ℂ³ defined by w = z̄₁z₂. Note that this submanifold is locally a diffeomorphic image of ℝ² × ℂ under a CR map (e.g., [13, Remark 1.3]) and is Levi-flat at CR points, so it is perhaps surprising that it has a large disc hull and in fact satisfies the strong iterated SADH condition at the origin (a CR singular point).\n\nTheorem 8.1.

For every CR singular point \\( q \\) of the unbounded submanifold defined by \\( w = \\overline{z}_1 z_2 \\), there exists an affine biholomorphic map of \\( \\mathbb{C}^3 \\) onto itself that sends this submanifold onto itself and the origin to \\( q \\). Thus, the existence of an iterated shrieking disc hull neighborhood for \\( M \\) at a given CR singular point follows from the existence of such a neighborhood at the origin. Also, note that through every CR point of \\( M \\) there is a connected nonsingular complex curve \\( \\Upsilon \\) (a subset of a complex line) such that \\( \\Upsilon \\subset M_{CR} \\) and the closure of \\( \\Upsilon \\) contains a CR singular point.\n\nProof. The submanifold \\( M \\) is bounded weighted homogeneous (use \\( \\alpha = (1, 1, 2) \\)). By rescaling it is sufficient to prove the result for any particular \\( \\delta \\). Therefore, suppose that \\( \\delta \\) is large enough so that the polydisc \\( \\Delta_C \\) which we define below fits within the set given by \\( \\|z\\|^4 + |w|^2 < \\delta \\).\n\nWe now show that \\( M \\) satisfies the strong iterated SADH condition at the origin. Fix \\( C > 3 \\), write \\( \\Delta_C \\) for the closed polydisc \\( \\{(\\xi_1, \\xi_2, \\omega) \\in \\mathbb{C}^3 : |\\xi_1|, |\\xi_2|, |\\omega| \\leq C\\} \\), and define \\( A_0 = \\Delta_C \\cap M \\). It suffices to prove that \\( A_0 \\) satisfies the the strong iterated SADH condition at the origin, which will follow from Lemma 4.11. We thus simply need to construct the iterated disc hull \\( DH^k(M) \\) and show that some iteration contains a nonempty Reinhardt domain.\n\nFirst step: We attach discs to \\( A_0 \\). Define\n\\[\nA_1 = \\Delta_C \\cap \\{ (\\xi_1, \\xi_2, \\omega) : \\operatorname{Im}(\\omega \\overline{\\xi}_1 \\xi_2) = 0,\\, \\operatorname{Re}(\\omega \\overline{\\xi}_1 \\xi_2) \\geq |\\xi_1 \\xi_2|^2,\\, |\\xi_2| / C \\leq |\\xi_1| \\leq C |\\xi_2| \\}. \\tag{28}\n\\]\n\nWe prove that if \\( p \\in A_1 \\) then there exists an analytic disc \\( \\varphi \\) attached to \\( A_0 \\) through \\( p \\). If also \\( p \\in A_0 \\), we can use a constant disc, so we assume \\( p \\notin A_0 \\). First fix a point \\( p = (z_1, z_2, w) \\in A_1 \\setminus A_0 \\) with \\( z_2 \\neq 0 \\). Then \\( z_1 \\neq 0 \\), so also \\( w \\neq 0 \\). Let \\( \\lambda > 0 \\) satisfy \\( \\lambda^2 = w z_1 / z_2 \\), so \\( |z_1| \\leq \\lambda \\). Define \\( \\varphi(\\zeta) = (\\lambda \\zeta, w \\zeta / \\lambda, w) \\). Note that \\( z_1 / \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{D} \\) and \\( \\varphi(z_1 / \\lambda) = p \\). Clearly \\( \\varphi \\) is attached to \\( M \\). It follows from \\( |w| \\leq C \\) and \\( |z_2| / C \\leq |z_1| \\leq C |z_2| \\) that \\( \\varphi \\) is in fact attached to \\( A_0 \\): \\( \\lambda = |w z_1 / z_2|^{1/2} \\leq C \\), and \\( |w / \\lambda| = |w||w z_1 / z_2|^{-1/2} \\leq C \\). Next, if \\( p = (z_1, 0, w) \\in A_1 \\setminus A_0 \\), then \\( z_1 \\neq 0 \\), and \\( p \\) belongs to a disc attached to \\( A_0 \\): Define \\( \\varphi(\\zeta) = (\\overline{w} \\zeta, \\zeta, w) \\). Thus, \\( A_1 \\subset DH(A_0) \\). This concludes the first step."

Define \\( M \\subset \\mathbb{C}^3 \\) by \\( M = \\{ (z_1, z_2, w) : w = |z_1|^2 - |z_2|^2, \\|z\\|^4 + |w|^2 < \\delta \\} \\) for a given \\( \\delta > 0 \\).\n\nProof. Note that the origin is the only CR singular point of \\( M \\). Furthermore, the manifold \\( M \\) is bounded weighted homogeneous, and we wish to work in some neighborhood of the origin. After rescaling, we will assume that \\( \\delta \\) is large enough. The construction below gives discs that can all fit within a neighborhood for a large enough \\( \\delta \\), and we will, for simplicity, avoid mentioning \\( \\delta \\) explicitly.\n\nFirst we consider functions that are real-analytic on \\( M \\). Fix \\( f \\in CR^\\omega(M) \\). Because the quadratic \\( |z_1|^2 - |z_2|^2 \\) satisfies the rank condition in [13, Theorem 1.1], \\( f \\) extends as a holomorphic function to a neighborhood of the origin in \\( \\mathbb{C}^3 \\). Because the origin is the only CR singular point of \\( M \\), \\( f \\in CR_H(M) \\). Thus, \\( CR^\\omega(M) = CR^\\omega_P(M) = CR_H(M) \\), and \\( CR^\\omega(M) \\) has the extension property at the origin. Because \\( M \\) is contained in the Levi-flat hypersurface given by \\( \\text{Im}\\,w = 0 \\), \\( CR_H(M) \\) does not have the fixed-neighborhood extension property at the origin. It remains to show that \\( CR^\\omega(M) \\) has the fixed-neighborhood approximation property at the origin.\n\nWe construct analytic discs. Let \\( A_1 = \\{(z_1, z_2, s) \\in \\mathbb{C}^2 \\times \\mathbb{R} : s \\geq 0, |z_1|^2 \\leq |z_2|^2 + s \\} \\). Assume that \\( p = (z_1, z_2, s) \\in A_1 \\). If \\( z_2 = s = 0 \\), then \\( z_1 = 0 \\), so \\( p \\in M \\). Now assume that \\( |z_2|^2 + s > 0 \\). Then \\( p \\) belongs to a disc attached to \\( M \\): Define \\( \\varphi(\\zeta) = (\\zeta, z_2, s) \\) for \\( |\\zeta|^2 \\leq |z_2|^2 + s \\). Then \\( \\varphi \\) is attached to \\( M \\). Also, \\( p \\) belongs to the disc because \\( |z_1|^2 \\leq |z_2|^2 + s \\).\n\nSimilarly, if \\( A_2 = \\{ (z_1, z_2, s) \\in \\mathbb{C}^2 \\times \\mathbb{R} : s \\geq 0, |z_2|^2 \\leq |z_1|^2 - s \\} \\) and \\( p = (z_1, z_2, s) \\in A_2 \\) with \\( |z_1|^2 - s > 0 \\), then \\( p \\) belongs to a disc attached to \\( M \\): Define \\( \\varphi(\\zeta) = (z_1, \\zeta, s) \\) for \\( |\\zeta|^2 \\leq |z_1|^2 - s \\). Then \\( \\varphi \\) is attached to \\( M \\). Also, \\( p \\) belongs to the disc because \\( |z_2|^2 \\leq |z_1|^2 - s \\).\n\nThus, for each fixed \\( s_0 \\geq 0 \\), discs attached to \\( M \\) cover \\( \\{ (z_1, z_2, s) : s = s_0 \\} \\). The same result is true if \\( s_0 < 0 \\). Given a disc \\( \\varphi(\\zeta) = (z_1(\\zeta), z_2(\\zeta), w(\\zeta)) \\), the family of discs \\( \\varphi_t(\\zeta) = (t z_1(\\zeta), t z_2(\\zeta), t^2 w(\\zeta)) \\) will stay attached to \\( M \\) and shrink to the origin as \\( t \\to 0 \\). This concludes the construction of analytic discs.\n\nNow let \\( f \\in CR^\\omega (M) \\). As we proved earlier, \\( f \\in CR_H(M) \\). By Lemma 2.4, we can extend \\( f \\) as a holomorphic function to a neighborhood of \\( M \\) in \\( \\mathbb{C}^3 \\). Now apply Corollary 4.7 to extend \\( f \\) to a fixed neighborhood (independent of \\( f \\)) of the origin in \\( \\mathbb{C}^2 \\times \\mathbb{R} \\), that is, extend \\( f \\) to a real-analytic CR function on this neighborhood. Therefore, \\( f \\) is holomorphic in \\( z \\) for any fixed \\( \\text{Re}\\, w \\), and we can make this neighborhood have the form \\( V \\times I \\) where \\( I \\) is an interval and \\( V \\) is a polydisc. Write \\( s = \\text{Re}\\, w \\). For fixed \\( s \\), use the partial sums of the Taylor series of the extension to get an approximation of \\( f \\) by a holomorphic polynomial whose coefficients depend on \\( s \\). Now use Theorem 4.12, with Remark 4.13, to get polynomials (in \\( (z_1, z_2, s) \\), hence in \\( (z_1, z_2, w) \\)) approximating \\( f \\) on a fixed neighborhood of the origin in \\( M \\)."
