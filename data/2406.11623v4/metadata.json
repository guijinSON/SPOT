      "text": "This paper redevelops Nevanlinna theory for meromorphic functions on ℂ in the viewpoint of holomorphic forms. According to our observation, Nevanlinna’s functions can be formulated by a holomorphic form. Applying this thought to Riemann surfaces, one then extends the definition of Nevanlinna’s functions using a holomorphic form 𝒮. With the new settings, an analogue of Nevanlinna theory for the 𝒮-exhausted Riemann surfaces is obtained, which is viewed as a generalization of the classical Nevanlinna theory for ℂ and 𝔻.\n\nMotivation. The paper is motivated by the early work of the first named author [4] (see also Atsuji [1]), who considered Nevanlinna theory for complete Kähler manifolds with nonpositive sectional curvature. To make it simpler, instead of Kähler manifolds, we restrict ourselves to the Riemann surfaces. In what follows, we introduce it without going into the details.\n\nLet S be a noncompact Riemann surface equipped with a complete Hermitian metric h of nonpositive Gauss curvature K. Fix a reference point o ∈ S. Set\n\nκ(r) = min{K(x) : x ∈ D(r)},\n\nwhere D(r) is a geodesic ball of radius r centered at o. Let f be a nonconstant meromorphic function on S. One can well define Nevanlinna’s functions T_f(r), m_f(r, a) and N_f(r, a) (see Section 3.1 in [4]). The first named author showed that (see Theorem 1.2 in [4]) for any δ > 0\n\n(q - 2)T_f(r) + T(r, ℜ) ≤ ∑_{j=1}^q N_f(r, a_j) + O(log T_f(r) + log C(o, r, δ))\n\nholds for all r ∈ (0, ∞) outside a set E_δ of finite Lebesgue measure, where C(o, r, δ) is a positive function with the estimate (see (19) in [4])\n\nlog C(r, o, δ) ≤ O(r√{-κ(r)} + δ log r),"

For example, we consider $S = \\mathbb{D}$, where $\\mathbb{D}$ is the unit disc. According to the conditions for metrics, one needs to equip $\\mathbb{D}$ with Poincaré metric (of curvature $-1$). In this situation, we have $\\kappa(r) \\equiv -1$. This gives that\n\n$$-r^2 \\leq T(r, \\mathcal{R}) \\leq 0.$$\n\nHowever, the best lower bound of $T(r, \\mathcal{R})$ is $O(-r)$.\n\nThe main drawback of the method in [4] is that the selectivity of metrics is restricted, i.e., the metrics have to be complete and nonpositively curved, but this will result in a rough estimate.\n\nIn this paper, we shall investigate Nevanlinna theory from the viewpoint of holomorphic forms $\\mathcal{S}$. With this idea, one generalizes the Nevanlinna theory to one class of noncompact Riemann surfaces which we call the $\\mathcal{S}$-exhausted Riemann surfaces. To begin with, let us describe how Nevanlinna's functions can be formulated by a holomorphic form $\\mathcal{S}$. To see it more clearly, we shall use the Ahlfors' characteristic function\n\n$$(1) \\qquad T_f(r) = \\int_1^r \\frac{dt}{t} \\int_{D(t)} f^* \\omega_{FS},$$\n\nA viewpoint of holomorphic forms. Let $f$ be a nonconstant meromorphic function on $\\mathbb{C}$, namely, the complex plane with standard Euclidean metric. Nevanlinna's characteristic function $T(r, f)$ of $f$ is well known [10] as\n\n$$T(r, f) := m(r, f) + N(r, f),$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$m(r, f) = \\int_{|z|=r} \\log^+ |f| \\frac{d\\theta}{2\\pi}, \\quad N(r, f) = \\int_0^r \\frac{n(t, f) - n(0, f)}{t} dt + n(0, f) \\log r$$\n\nare called the proximity function and counting function of $f$ respectively, in which, $n(r, f)$ denotes the number of poles of $f$ on the disc $D(r) := \\{|z| < r\\}$. Characteristic function is an important notion, it characterizes the growth of meromorphic functions, using which Nevanlinna [10] in 1925 established two fundamental theorems: First Main Theorem and Second Main Theorem, named Nevanlinna theory. Nevanlinna theory plays a central role in complex analysis and hyperbolic geometry. Roughly speaking, this theory studies the size of images of meromorphic functions or mappings in target spaces; it is a great generalization of the Little Picard Theorem saying that a meromorphic function must be a constant if it omits three distinct values in $\\mathbb{C}$."

Choosing 𝒮, a nowhere-vanishing holomorphic form on 𝒮 such that ẋ = ∫ₒˣ 𝒮 defines a holomorphic function, where o is a fixed point in 𝒮. Following [6], such a form always exists. If 𝒮 is 𝒮-exhausted, i.e., any sequence of 𝒮-discs exhausts 𝒮 when radius approaches increasingly to R^𝒮, where R^𝒮 is the 𝒮-radius of 𝒮 with respect to o, see Definition 2.7. To a 𝒮-exhausted surface 𝒮, T_f^𝒮(r), m_f^𝒮(r, a) and N_f^𝒮(r, a) of a meromorphic function f on 𝒮 can be similarly defined and they make sense, see Notations on page 63 for the definition. By computing Green functions and harmonic measures, we shall establish an analogue of Nevanlinna theory, which turns out to be an extension of the classical Nevanlinna theory for ℂ and 𝔻 (unit disc); see, e.g., [10; 11; 14; 15]."
