In the present study, we investigated the effect of substituting costimulatory domains and spacers in this STEAP1 CAR. We cloned four CAR constructs with either CD28 or 4-1BB costimulatory domains, combined with a CD8a-spacer (sp) or a mutated IgG-spacer. The CAR T-cells were evaluated in short- and long-term in vitro T-cell assays, measuring cytokine production, tumor cell killing, and CAR T-cell expansion and phenotype. A xenograft mouse model of prostate cancer was used for in vivo comparison. All four CAR constructs conferred CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with STEAP1-specific functionality. A CD8sp_41BBz construct and an IgGsp_CD28z construct were selected for a more extensive comparison. The IgGsp_CD28z CAR gave stronger cytokine responses and killing in overnight caspase assays. However, the 41BB-containing CAR mediated more killing (IncuCyte) over one week. Upon six repeated stimulations, the CD8sp_41BBz CAR T cells showed superior expansion and lower expression of exhaustion markers (PD1, LAG3, TIGIT, TIM3, and CD25). In vivo, both the CAR T variants had comparable anti-tumor activity, but persisting CAR T-cells in tumors were only detected for the 41BBz variant. In conclusion, the CD8sp_41BBz STEAP1 CAR T cells had superior expansion and survival in vitro and in vivo, compared to the IgGsp_CD28z counterpart, and a less exhausted phenotype upon repeated antigen exposure. Such persistence may be important for clinical efficacy.\n\n**Keywords:** chimeric antigen receptor; STEAP1; costimulatory domain; CAR spacer; 4-1BB; CD28; cell therapy; prostate cancer; xenograft mouse model; T cell phenotype",

It is, therefore, crucial to target a CAR-antigen that is retained in aggressive\n                             cancer and unlikely to be lost during metastasis. In most CARs, the antigen-binding part is\n                             a single-chain fragment variable (scFv) derived from an antibody (Ab) that is then fused\n                             to the CD3zeta (CD3ζ) signaling domain from the T cell receptor (TCR). The addition of a\n                             costimulatory domain introduced in second-generation CARs led to the clinical efficacy of\n                             CAR T cell therapy [4,12].\n                                      We have developed a CAR where the scFv recognizes the protein six-transmembrane\n                             epithelial antigen of prostate-1 (STEAP1), a protein expressed in multiple cancer forms [13].\n                             STEAP1 has been shown to be associated with tumor proliferation and progression [14–18].\n                             Furthermore, several studies have indicated that STEAP1 promotes tumor invasion into\n                             various organs and the peritoneum [17–19]. STEAP1 is expressed in ~90% of prostate\n                             cancers and in sizeable subpopulations of other cancer types such as pancreatic cancer,\n                             glioblastoma, lung cancer, bladder cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, leukemia, lym-\n                             phoma, and head and neck cancer [14,15,20,21]. Furthermore, a key oncogenic driver in\n                             pediatric Ewing’s sarcoma is a chromosomal translocation giving the fused EWSFLI1 gene,\n                             which leads to the upregulation of STEAP1 [14–16,22–24].\n                                  In normal tissues, STEAP1 is mainly expressed in the prostate, which is not a vital\n                             organ and can be removed. Some reports have indicated low/moderate STEAP1 expression\n                             in other tissues, such as adipose tissue and the bladder [14,15,20]. However, across different\n                             studies, a consistent normal tissue expression of STEAP1 has only been shown in prostate\n                             tissue. The first trial with a STEAP1-targeting drug (an antibody–drug conjugate) indicated\n                             a favorable safety profile, and the side effects noted in this trial were not considered related\n                             to STEAP1-directed toxicity [25]. At ESMO in October 2023, interim results were reported\n                             from a phase 1 study of a bispecific antibody against STEAP1 in patients with castration-\n                             resistant metastatic prostate cancer [26]. Here, the authors concluded that the drug was\n                             tolerable, encouraging preliminary efficacy.\n                            The costimulatory CAR domain confers T cells with more potent effector functions [27] and\n                             appears crucial for the persistence of CAR T cells in vivo and for their clinical activity [4,12,28].\n                             The most commonly used costimulatory CAR domains are derived from CD28 or 4-1BB,\n                               whereas other alternatives like OX-40, GITR, and ICOS have also been explored [29–31].\n                             Most studies have been conducted with CD19-targeting CARs against hematological can-\n                             cers.

Cloning and Expression of Alternative STEAP1 CAR Constructs\n\nWe cloned four STEAP1-specific CAR T constructs based on the Oslo1 scFv by combining two alternative costimulatory domains (CD28, 4-1BB) with different extracellular spacers (sp), based on CD8a or IgG1 (Figure 1): Oslo1_IgGsp_CD28z (JK10), Oslo1_CD8sp_41BBz (JK11), Oslo1_IgGsp_41BBz (JK15), Oslo1_CD8sp_CD28z (JK16). The IgG1-spacer had four aa mutations to prevent binding to Fc-receptors, as reported by Hombach et al. [34]. All four constructs had identical transmembrane (TM) domains from CD8a.

All four STEAP1 CAR variants were expressed well on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with a transduction efficacy in primary T cells ranging from 45% to 90% (Figure 1B).",

          "value": "treatment is resource-demanding and likely to be applied only for the treatment of refractory cancers. It is, therefore, crucial to target a CAR-antigen that is retained in aggressive cancer and unlikely to be lost during metastasis. In most CARs, the antigen-binding part is a single-chain fragment variable (scFv) derived from an antibody (Ab) that is then fused to the CD3zeta (CD3ζ) signaling domain from the T cell receptor (TCR). The addition of a costimulatory domain introduced in second-generation CARs led to the clinical efficacy of CAR T cell therapy [4,12].\n\nWe have developed a CAR where the scFv recognizes the protein six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate-1 (STEAP1), a protein expressed in multiple cancer forms [13]. STEAP1 has been shown to be associated with tumor proliferation and progression [14–18]. Furthermore, several studies have indicated that STEAP1 promotes tumor invasion into various organs and the peritoneum [17–19]. STEAP1 is expressed in ~90% of prostate cancers and in sizeable subpopulations of other cancer types such as pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, lung cancer, bladder cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, and head and neck cancer [14,15,20,21]. Furthermore, a key oncogenic driver in pediatric Ewing's sarcoma is a chromosomal translocation giving the fused EWSFLI1 gene, which leads to the upregulation of STEAP1 [14–16,22–24].\n\nIn normal tissues, STEAP1 is mainly expressed in the prostate, which is not a vital organ and can be removed. Some reports have indicated low/moderate STEAP1 expression in other tissues, such as adipose tissue and the bladder [14,15,20]. However, across different studies, a consistent normal tissue expression of STEAP1 has only been shown in prostate tissue. The first trial with a STEAP1-targeting drug (an antibody–drug conjugate) indicated a favorable safety profile, and the side effects noted in this trial were not considered related to STEAP1-directed toxicity [25]. At ESMO in October 2023, interim results were reported from a phase 1 study of a bispecific antibody against STEAP1 in patients with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer [26]. Here, the authors concluded that the drug was tolerable, encouraging preliminary efficacy.\n\nThe costimulatory CAR domain confers T cells with more potent effector functions [27] and appears crucial for the persistence of CAR T cells in vivo and for their clinical activity [4,12,28]. The most commonly used costimulatory CAR domains are derived from CD28 or 4-1BB, whereas other alternatives like OX-40, GITR, and ICOS have also been explored [29–31]. Most studies have been conducted with CD19-targeting CARs against hematological cancers. However, the optimal costimulatory domain may differ between different cancer forms, target antigens, and CAR constructs. The binding properties of the CAR scFv also influence the signaling levels [32]. The CAR spacers should facilitate appropriate binding of the scFv to the particular target epitope and, in some cases, need to be tailored [33]. Moreover, some spacers may bind to host receptors and cause off-target activation [30,34]. In the present study, we investigated the effect of substituting costimulatory domains and spacers in the STEAP1 CAR.",

The suicide/sorter/marker gene RQR8 [35] was cloned into each construct in tandem with the CAR. RQR8 may be used for the elimination of transduced cells with rituximab. Here, we use it as a marker to identify the expression of the CAR construct. STEAP1 CAR expression after transduction of primary T cells was assessed by flow cytometry. All four STEAP1 CAR variants were expressed well on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with a transduction efficacy in primary T cells ranging from 45% to 90% (Figure 1B).",

T Cells Expressing Four Alternative CAR T Variants Specifically Kill STEAP1+ Target Cells\n                                We investigated the ability of the four CAR T cell variants to kill tumor cells by\n                            analyzing the induction of active caspase-3 in STEAP1+ target cells (prostate cancer cell\n                            line 22Rv1). Apoptosis of the 22Rv1 target cells was measured by analyzing the intensity of\n                            FITC-DEVD-FMK bound to active caspase-3 by flow cytometry. Dead cells were excluded\n                         with Fixable Viability Dye, and T cells were excluded by staining for CD3. Representative\n                            contour plots are shown in Figure 1. The results showed that all four CAR T constructs\n                            enabled recipient T cells to specifically kill STEAP1+ target cells. The induction of active\n                            caspase-3 was 4-fold increased when 22Rv1 cells were cultured together with STEAP1 CAR\n                            T cells, compared to non-transduced control T cells (Figure 1).\n\n                            2.3. CD28-CAR T Cells Produce More IFNγ and TNFα Than 41BB-CAR T Cells\n                          We selected the most dissimilar STEAP1 CAR constructs, where both the spacer and costim-\n                            ulatory domain were different, for systematic comparative evaluation in vitro and in vivo. The\n                            expression of these constructs, Oslo1_IgGsp_CD28z (JK10) and Oslo1_CD8sp_41BBz (JK11), was\n                            investigated by repeated transductions (n = 17) of primary T cells from healthy donors.\n                            As shown in Figure 1, the CAR expression was high (>70%) for both JK10 and JK11, still\n                            significantly higher for JK10 (p = 0.048).\n                                     Next, we compared the cytokine response in the Oslo1_IgGsp_CD28z (JK10; CD28-\n                            CAR) and Oslo1_CD8sp_41BBz (JK11; 41BB-CAR) CAR T cells. As controls, we employed\n                            T cells expressing an irrelevant CD19 CAR and non-transduced T cells. The CD19 CAR is\n                            identical to JK11, except for the scFv, and resembles the construct used in tisagenlecleucel\n                            (fmc63scFv_CD8aTM/spacer_41BB-z), which is approved for use against leukemia [1]. The\n                            T cells were co-cultured overnight with tumor target cells using a panel of STEAP1-positive\n                            (22Rv1, C2-4B, LNCap) and STEAP1-negative (22Rv1 STEAP1 knockout) prostate cancer\n                            cells that we have previously described [13,36]. The production of IFNγ and TNFα was\n                            measured by flow cytometry.\n                                 A representative experiment is shown in Figures 2 and 3. The results demonstrated\n                            that both of the CAR T cell variants, JK10 and JK11, produced IFNγ (Figure 2) and TNFα\n                            (Figure 3) upon encounter with all three STEAP1 positive target cell lines, but not with\n                            the STEAP1 negative controls. The IFNγ response was stronger in CD8+ CAR T cells,\n                            whereas the CD4+ CAR T cells produced more TNFα. Interestingly, T cells expressing the\n                            Igsp_CD28 CAR (JK10) generally produced more of both IFNγ and TNFα compared to the\n                            CD8sp_41BB CAR T cells (JK11).

JK10 and\n                            JK11 CAR T cells, as well as CD19 CAR and NT T cell controls, were cultured with STEAP1-\n                            positive target cells (22Rv1, LNCap, C2-4B), or with STEAP1-negative (22Rv1 KO, C2-4B\n                            KO) or STEAP1-low (shRNA knockdown) targets. The assays demonstrated that both JK10\n                            and JK11 CAR T cells killed the target cells in an STEAP1-specific manner.

      "md": "2.2. T Cells Expressing Four Alternative CAR T Variants Specifically Kill STEAP1+ Target Cells\n\nWe investigated the ability of the four CAR T cell variants to kill tumor cells by analyzing the induction of active caspase-3 in STEAP1+ target cells (prostate cancer cell line 22Rv1). Apoptosis of the 22Rv1 target cells was measured by analyzing the intensity of FITC-DEVD-FMK bound to active caspase-3 by flow cytometry. Dead cells were excluded with Fixable Viability Dye, and T cells were excluded by staining for CD3. Representative contour plots are shown in Figure 1. The results showed that all four CAR T constructs enabled recipient T cells to specifically kill STEAP1+ target cells. The induction of active caspase-3 was 4-fold increased when 22Rv1 cells were cultured together with STEAP1 CAR T cells, compared to non-transduced control T cells (Figure 1).\n\n2.3. CD28-CAR T Cells Produce More IFNγ and TNFα Than 41BB-CAR T Cells\n\nWe selected the most dissimilar STEAP1 CAR constructs, where both the spacer and costimulatory domain were different, for systematic comparative evaluation in vitro and in vivo. The expression of these constructs, Oslo1_IgGsp_CD28z (JK10) and Oslo1_CD8sp_41BBz (JK11), was investigated by repeated transductions (n = 17) of primary T cells from healthy donors. As shown in Figure 1, the CAR expression was high (>70%) for both JK10 and JK11, still significantly higher for JK10 (p = 0.048).\n\nNext, we compared the cytokine response in the Oslo1_IgGsp_CD28z (JK10; CD28-CAR) and Oslo1_CD8sp_41BBz (JK11; 41BB-CAR) CAR T cells. As controls, we employed T cells expressing an irrelevant CD19 CAR and non-transduced T cells. The CD19 CAR is identical to JK11, except for the scFv, and resembles the construct used in tisagenlecleucel (fmc63scFv_CD8aTM/spacer_41BB-z), which is approved for use against leukemia [1]. The T cells were co-cultured overnight with tumor target cells using a panel of STEAP1-positive (22Rv1, C2-4B, LNCap) and STEAP1-negative (22Rv1 STEAP1 knockout) prostate cancer cells that we have previously described [13,36]. The production of IFNγ and TNFα was measured by flow cytometry.\n\nA representative experiment is shown in Figures 2 and 3. The results demonstrated that both of the CAR T cell variants, JK10 and JK11, produced IFNγ (Figure 2) and TNFα (Figure 3) upon encounter with all three STEAP1 positive target cell lines, but not with the STEAP1 negative controls. The IFNγ response was stronger in CD8+ CAR T cells, whereas the CD4+ CAR T cells produced more TNFα. Interestingly, T cells expressing the Igsp_CD28 CAR (JK10) generally produced more of both IFNγ and TNFα compared to the CD8sp_41BB CAR T cells (JK11). There was some variation in the response to the different target cells, as the proportion of CAR T cells responding to stimulation with 22Rv1 was usually higher than to LNCap or C2-4B.

(B) Representative dot plots of TNFα production by the four types of T cells co-cultured with 22Rv1 cells. (C) TNFα production in CD4+ (left) or CD8+ (right) T cells. The T cells were gated on RQR8+ (a marker for CAR expression) or CD3, CD4, or CD8 for the non-transduced cells. Data in A and C are the means of quadruplicates, with error bars representing SD. * p < 0.01, ** p < 0.001, *** p < 0.0001 (t-test).",

We investigated this question in vitro by subjecting the CAR T cells to six repeated stimulations from STEAP1+ tumor cells over 21 days while monitoring their expansion and phenotypic development (Figure 5A). Twice per week, half of the T cells were transferred to a new plate seeded with freshly irradiated target cells. The remaining T cells were then counted using flow cytometry counting beads. The results revealed distinct differences between the JK10 (CD28-CAR) and JK11 (41BB-CAR) T cells. Both JK10 and JK11 initially proliferated in response to the presence of STEAP1, with cell numbers peaking at 14 days (Figure 5B). However, JK11 CAR T cells proliferated significantly more than CAR T cells containing JK10, reaching much greater cell numbers and maintaining levels at four times their original cell number to the end of the assay (day 21).",

The same phenotype characterization was performed on PBMCs from this blood donor as well as after the initial one-week stimulation/expansion necessary for retroviral CAR transduction (JK10 or JK11). As shown in Figure 5C,D, the initial stimulation and CAR transduction of PBMCs led to an increase in the CD4/CD8 ratio, upregulation of the activation marker CD25, and the checkpoints LAG3 and TIM3. This was the same for both JK10 and JK11 CAR T cells, but the upregulation of CD25, LAG3, and TIM3 was more pronounced for JK10.\n\nThe CAR T cells were then frozen–thawed and used in the assay described above, with stimulation from STEAP1 tumor cells twice per week. Over the 18 days monitored, the majority of JK10 cells were CD4+, whereas the proportion of CD8+ cells gradually increased over time for JK11, reaching >60% at day 18 (Figure 5C). The JK10 cells remained mostly (>90%) CD25 positive, suggesting an activated phenotype. The CD25 expression increased even for JK11 cells and reached about 80% in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from day 4. LAG3, PD1, TIGIT, and TIM3, which are markers of activation and exhaustion, were all expressed at considerably higher levels on JK10 cells compared to JK11. A large proportion of JK11 T cells remained negative for LAG3, TIM3, or PD1, whereas 70–90% of JK10 cells expressed each of these markers. TIGIT was expressed in a few CAR T cells before the first stimulation with STEAP1+ tumor cells. In JK11 T cells, the expression increased only moderately to about 30%, whereas it increased to 70–80% in the JK10 cell population. The expression of PD1, LAG3, and TIM3 was higher in the CD8+ than CD4+ subsets for both JK10 and JK11 CAR T cells.\n\nWe also investigated T cell differentiation/maturation by classifying the CAR T cells into naive, effector memory (EM), central memory (CM), or terminally differentiated (TEMRA) cells based on well-established markers (CD45RA, CCR7; Supplementary Figure S1). The data showed that >95% of T cells acquired an effector memory or central memory phenotype after the initial activation with retroviral transduction. After the repeated stimulations with STEAP1+ tumor cells, the majority of both JK10 and JK11 CAR T cells acquired an EM phenotype. At the end of the assay (day 18), 90% of CD4+ JK10 cells and 70% of CD4+ JK11 cells were EM cells, as were ~65% of CD8+ JK10 and JK11 cells. The TEMRA percentage remained low (<5%).\n\n## 2.8.

The same phenotype characterization was performed on PBMCs from this blood donor as well as after the initial one-week stimulation/expansion necessary for retroviral CAR transduction (JK10 or JK11). As shown in Figure 5C,D, the initial stimulation and CAR transduction of PBMCs led to an increase in the CD4/CD8 ratio, upregulation of the activation marker CD25, and the checkpoints LAG3 and TIM3. This was the same for both JK10 and JK11 CAR T cells, but the upregulation of CD25, LAG3, and TIM3 was more pronounced for JK10.\n\nThe CAR T cells were then frozen–thawed and used in the assay described above, with stimulation from STEAP1 tumor cells twice per week. Over the 18 days monitored, the majority of JK10 cells were CD4+, whereas the proportion of CD8+ cells gradually increased over time for JK11, reaching >60% at day 18 (Figure 5C). The JK10 cells remained mostly (>90%) CD25 positive, suggesting an activated phenotype. The CD25 expression increased even for JK11 cells and reached about 80% in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from day 4. LAG3, PD1, TIGIT, and TIM3, which are markers of activation and exhaustion, were all expressed at considerably higher levels on JK10 cells compared to JK11. A large proportion of JK11 T cells remained negative for LAG3, TIM3, or PD1, whereas 70–90% of JK10 cells expressed each of these markers. TIGIT was expressed in a few CAR T cells before the first stimulation with STEAP1+ tumor cells. In JK11 T cells, the expression increased only moderately to about 30%, whereas it increased to 70–80% in the JK10 cell population. The expression of PD1, LAG3, and TIM3 was higher in the CD8+ than CD4+ subsets for both JK10 and JK11 CAR T cells.\n\nWe also investigated T cell differentiation/maturation by classifying the CAR T cells into naive, effector memory (EM), central memory (CM), or terminally differentiated (TEMRA) cells based on well-established markers (CD45RA, CCR7; Supplementary Figure S1). The data showed that >95% of T cells acquired an effector memory or central memory phenotype after the initial activation with retroviral transduction. After the repeated stimulations with STEAP1+ tumor cells, the majority of both JK10 and JK11 CAR T cells acquired an EM phenotype. At the end of the assay (day 18), 90% of CD4+ JK10 cells and 70% of CD4+ JK11 cells were EM cells, as were ~65% of CD8+ JK10 and JK11 cells. The TEMRA percentage remained low (<5%).",

Irradiated 22Rv1 target cells were seeded at 1 × 10⁶/well in 24-well plates. After 1 day (day 0), CAR T cells were thawed and added at 1 × 10⁶/well.

Discussion\n\nStudies of CAR T cells with various specificities, as well as the clinical experience with CD19 CAR T products, have indicated that costimulatory domains and spacers substantially influence clinical activity [4,12]. We have previously reported the development of a STEAP1 CAR (JK11) with a 41BB-costimulatory domain and transmembrane I and spacer (sp) domains derived from CD8a. This choice of design was based on the fact that a CD19 CAR with the same backbone has robust clinical activity and is approved for clinical use against B-cell cancers. In the present study, we investigated how alternative costimulatory domains and spacers in the CAR influenced the in vitro and in vivo activity of the STEAP1 CAR. The purpose was to compare the activity of the JK11 CAR construct to alternative second-generation CAR designs based on the same Oslo1 scFv before bringing the CAR into clinical development.\n\nThe results of the initial experiments showed that the four CAR constructs tested were expressed well in primary CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and that they all conferred recipient T cells with STEAP1-specific activity. For a more extensive comparison, we focused on the two most different CAR constructs, i.e., Oslo1_IgGsp_CD28z (JK10) and Oslo1_CD8sp_41BBz (JK11).

We have previously reported the development of a STEAP1 CAR (JK11) with a 41BB-costimulatory domain and transmembrane I and spacer (sp) domains derived from CD8a. This choice of design was based on the fact that a CD19 CAR with the same backbone has robust clinical activity and is approved for clinical use against B-cell cancers. In the present study, we investigated how alternative costimulatory domains and spacers in the CAR influenced the in vitro and in vivo activity of the STEAP1 CAR. The purpose was to compare the activity of the JK11 CAR construct to alternative second-generation CAR designs based on the same Oslo1 scFv before bringing the CAR into clinical development.\n\nThe results of the initial experiments showed that the four CAR constructs tested were expressed well in primary CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and that they all conferred recipient T cells with STEAP1-specific activity. For a more extensive comparison, we focused on the two most different CAR constructs, i.e., Oslo1_IgGsp_CD28z (JK10) and Oslo1_CD8sp_41BBz (JK11). We found that the JK10 CAR had a stronger IFNγ and TNFα response, as measured in overnight co-culture assays with tumor target cells. Similarly, the JK10 CAR T also showed a more potent killing capacity in short-term assays. These observations are in line with data from other CAR constructs with other specificities. In multiple in vitro studies, CARs with CD28 costimulatory domains outperform other constructs with alternative costimulatory domains [27,29]. However, the clinical breakthrough in CAR T cell therapy arrived with a 41BBz CAR with the same backbone (cd8aTM/sp-41BBz) as JK11 [37]. Several studies have suggested that the 41BBz construct has superior survival and long-term persistence upon repeated antigen exposure [12,28,31]. This may, however, vary depending on the construct and target in accordance with the binding patterns and resulting signaling.\n\nTo investigate how the STEAP1 CAR T variants responded to repeated antigen stimulation, we performed long-term assays with repeated stimulations of the JK10 and JK11",

Interestingly, the JK11 T cells expanded far more\n                             over time than JK10. Both JK10 and JK11 CAR T cells acquired an activated phenotype with\n                             expression of the measured activation/exhaustion markers (CD25, PD1, LAG3, TIGIT, and\n                             TIM3). However, the JK11 cells expressed less of all these markers, and a large proportion\n                             of JK11 T cells remained negative for PD1, LAG3, TIGIT, and TIM3, suggesting a less\n                             exhausted phenotype. Moreover, the JK11 CAR T cells outperformed the JK10 cells in\n                             long-term live-imaging IncuCyte killing assays, which lasted for one week. Taken together,\n                             the in vitro data thus suggested that the JK11 CAR T cells have superior expansion and\n                             persistence upon long-term and repeated antigen exposure and also mediate more effective\n                             tumor cell killing over time.\n                                       Furthermore, we evaluated CAR T efficacy in vivo using the same mouse model in\n                             which we had previously evaluated the JK11 CAR. In this model, both the JK10 and JK11\n                             CAR T cells had significant anti-tumor activity, and we did not observe any difference in\n                             their effect on tumor burden, as measured by IVIS and caliper. In spite of their similar\n                             anti-tumor activity, we did observe a difference in the tumor infiltration by JK10 and JK11\n                             T cells at the end of the experiment. Persisting CAR T cells in the tumor were only detected\n                             for JK11. This observation supports the hypothesis that the 41BBz CAR T cells may have\n                             superior survival properties, which is in line with our observations in the long-term in vitro\n                             assays and other research groups that have reported similar observations with other CAR T\n                             products [12,31]. Such persistence may be important for durable clinical efficacy, including\n                             protection against tumor relapse.\n                              In a previous study of CD19 CAR T cells, we found that CAR T cells with excellent anti-\n                             tumor activity in vitro did not work in vivo, using an NSG mouse model. This discrepancy\n                             was due to the binding of the IgG-domain to FcR in the NSG mice, which in turn caused\n                             activation-induced cell death of the CAR T cells, as well as important toxicity [30]. In the\n                             present study, the STEAP1 CAR with the mutated IgG-spacer showed activity in vivo, with\n                             no weight loss or other signs of toxicity. This observation supports the concept that the\n                             four mutations reported by Hombach et al. [34] in the Ig-derived spacer serve to prevent\n                             binding to the mouse FcR, significantly reducing AICD and toxicity in this animal model.\n                                         The JK10 and JK11 CAR constructs include the suicide/marker gene RQR8, which\n                             allows for the elimination of CAR T cells with rituximab [35]. Such a safety gene offers no\n                             guarantee that all CAR T cells can be eliminated and is not in general required for clinical\n                             development but may offer a level of increased safety. An arguably safer alternative would\n                             be transient mRNA-based retargeting, which we used in the above-mentioned CD19 CAR\n                             T study [30] and have also combined with RQR8 [38]. However, there is no evidence of\n                             clinical efficacy from mRNA-based CAR T cells, and even this approach does not protect\n                             against immediate toxicity. Both JK10 and JK11 CAR-T cells were generated using a gamma-\n                             retroviral vector. Similar gamma-retroviral delivery systems are currently used in clinically\n                             approved CAR-T products (axicabtagene ciloleucel, brexucabtagene autoleucel) [39,40].\n                             There are as yet no clinical data from CAR T cell trials targeting STEAP1. The JK11 CAR was,\n                             to our knowledge, the first CAR developed against STEAP1; however, recently, one more\n                             STEAP1 CAR has been reported [41]. As mentioned, the target STEAP1 has been evaluated\n                             in two clinical studies with antibody-based drugs, which were considered tolerable with\n                             some evidence of clinical activity [25,26].\n                              There are certain limitations in the study reported herein. This study was not designed\n                             to provide definite evidence regarding the superiority of any of the CAR constructs. Rather,\n                             this study represents a screening of common CAR T design variants to support the choice\n                             of a CAR for clinical development.     The in vivo direct comparison has, therefore, not\n                             been repeated, and the findings from this experiment should be interpreted with caution.\n                             The JK11 CAR construct has, however, shown robust in vivo activity in multiple animal\n                             experiments [13]). In order to move the JK11 CAR towards clinical development, we are\n                             conducting further animal experiments with this construct. We used NSG mice, which are\n                             deficient in B and T cells and do not produce cytokines (common gamma chain mutation)\n                             necessary for homeostatic survival and functional activity of lymphoid cells.

This observation supports the hypothesis that the 41BBz CAR T cells may have superior survival properties, which is in line with our observations in the long-term in vitro assays and other research groups that have reported similar observations with other CAR T products [12,31]. Such persistence may be important for durable clinical efficacy, including protection against tumor relapse.\n\nIn a previous study of CD19 CAR T cells, we found that CAR T cells with excellent anti-tumor activity in vitro did not work in vivo, using an NSG mouse model. This discrepancy was due to the binding of the IgG-domain to FcR in the NSG mice, which in turn caused activation-induced cell death of the CAR T cells, as well as important toxicity [30]. In the present study, the STEAP1 CAR with the mutated IgG-spacer showed activity in vivo, with no weight loss or other signs of toxicity. This observation supports the concept that the four mutations reported by Hombach et al. [34] in the Ig-derived spacer serve to prevent binding to the mouse FcR, significantly reducing AICD and toxicity in this animal model.\n\nThe JK10 and JK11 CAR constructs include the suicide/marker gene RQR8, which allows for the elimination of CAR T cells with rituximab [35]. Such a safety gene offers no guarantee that all CAR T cells can be eliminated and is not in general required for clinical development but may offer a level of increased safety. An arguably safer alternative would be transient mRNA-based retargeting, which we used in the above-mentioned CD19 CAR T study [30] and have also combined with RQR8 [38]. However, there is no evidence of clinical efficacy from mRNA-based CAR T cells, and even this approach does not protect against immediate toxicity. Both JK10 and JK11 CAR-T cells were generated using a gamma-retroviral vector. Similar gamma-retroviral delivery systems are currently used in clinically approved CAR-T products (axicabtagene ciloleucel, brexucabtagene autoleucel) [39,40]. There are as yet no clinical data from CAR T cell trials targeting STEAP1. The JK11 CAR was, to our knowledge, the first CAR developed against STEAP1; however, recently, one more STEAP1 CAR has been reported [41]. As mentioned, the target STEAP1 has been evaluated in two clinical studies with antibody-based drugs, which were considered tolerable with some evidence of clinical activity [25,26].\n\nThere are certain limitations in the study reported herein. This study was not designed to provide definite evidence regarding the superiority of any of the CAR constructs. Rather, this study represents a screening of common CAR T design variants to support the choice of a CAR for clinical development. The in vivo direct comparison has, therefore, not been repeated, and the findings from this experiment should be interpreted with caution. The JK11 CAR construct has, however, shown robust in vivo activity in multiple animal experiments [13]). In order to move the JK11 CAR towards clinical development, we are conducting further animal experiments with this construct. We used NSG mice, which are deficient in B and T cells and do not produce cytokines (common gamma chain mutation) necessary for homeostatic survival and functional activity of lymphoid cells.

Statistical Analysis\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9. Student t-tests were used for statistical comparison groups in the in vitro assays. Mann–Whitney U test was used for statistical comparisons of tumor size between two groups in the in vivo experiment. All p-values given are two-tailed values.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nThese findings suggest that both JK10 and JK11 CAR T cells have robust STEAP1-specific anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo without detectable off-target effects or toxicity. Furthermore, these results indicate superior expansion, survival, and persistence of the JK11 T cells, with less expression of phenotypic exhaustion markers compared to the JK10 variant. The leap from animal models to patients is huge, and for clinical development, it is reasonable to choose a construct resembling one with proven efficacy, as does JK11. Based on these considerations, we conclude that there is a basis for developing the JK11 STEAP1 CAR for clinical testing.\n\nSupplementary Materials: The supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms25010586/s1.\n\nAuthor Contributions: Y.J. and J.A.K. conceived and designed the study and the experiments.
