Introduction\n\nHuman pose estimation presents a critical challenge within the field of computer vision, bearing significant implications across a diverse array of applications, ranging from interactive gaming and virtual reality to clinical rehabilitation and security. Notwithstanding the substantial advancements catalysed by deep learning technologies, real-world environments' dynamic and often unpredictable nature continues to pose notable challenges. These encompass handling rapid movements, diverse postures, and intricate interactions within occluded environments.\n\nMediaPipe, an open-source framework pioneered by Google, has surfaced as a potent tool offering robust, real-time, multi-person pose estimation capabilities. Nevertheless, its standard deployment necessitates further refinement to satisfy the exacting demands of real-time processing and high accuracy within complex operational environments.\n\nThis study is devoted to augmenting the MediaPipe framework by integrating sophisticated algorithmic enhancements and optimisations. Our objectives are twofold:\n\n- To substantially enhance the accuracy and celerity of pose estimation, ensuring robust performance even under rapid movement and partial occlusion conditions.\n\n- To extend the utility of MediaPipe into novel application areas such as telemedicine and sports analytics, where precise and real-time pose estimation can provide transformative benefits.\n\nWe appraise existing methodologies and their limitations when applied to the intricate scenarios that typify real-world applications. Subsequently, the paper elucidates the proposed enhancements to the MediaPipe framework, delineates our experimental setup, and discourses the findings from comprehensive tests. Ultimately, this research contributes to the broader domain of computer vision by furnishing a more robust solution that enhances the practical usability and scalability of human pose estimation technologies.\n\nThe enhancements addressed existing lacunae and established a new benchmark in pose estimation capabilities, proffering insights into integrating such technologies in both extant and emerging markets.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows, Section 2 provides the related work. Section 3 explores the methodology part. Sections 4 and 5 provide the experimental results and discussion along with the conclusion respectively.\n\n## 2. Related Work\n\nThe field of human pose estimation has witnessed remarkable progress, particularly with the advent of deep learning technologies. This section reviews the key advancements in this domain, highlights existing gaps in contemporary research, and justifies the present study's focus on addressing these challenges. By providing a comprehensive overview of the current landscape, this section lays the foundation for understanding the motivations and contributions of our work.\n\n### 2.1. Advancements in Human Pose Estimation\n\nHuman pose estimation technologies have dramatically advanced due to deep learning.

Current models perform well under controlled conditions but often falter in complex real-world scenarios characterized by rapid movements, varying lighting conditions, and occlusions Li et al. (2021). Moreover, while accuracy has been a primary focus, the computational efficiency necessary for deployment on low-power devices frequently remains unaddressed.\n\nFurthermore, existing frameworks often overlook the integration of real-time feedback mechanisms, which are essential for interactive applications such as augmented reality and live sports analytics Wang et al. (2021).\n\n## 2.3. Justification for the Present Study\n\nThis research addresses these gaps by advancing the MediaPipe framework and enhancing its robustness and computational efficiency. The proposed modifications aim to improve pose estimation accuracy in dynamically challenging environments while reducing the computational load to facilitate broader deployment, especially on mobile platforms.\n\nMoreover, by enhancing the framework's ability to handle real-time data processing, this study extends its applicability to fields that depend on immediate pose estimation, such as telemedicine and personal fitness apps, where quick and accurate feedback is critical Bazarevsky and Grishchenko (2020).\n\nSummary—This section has reviewed key advancements and identified critical gaps in the field of human pose estimation, setting the stage for the subsequent presentation of this study's contributions, which focus on overcoming these limitations to push the boundaries of what is currently achievable.\n\n# 3. Methodology\n\nThis section outlines the research design, system architecture, data collection, and analysis methods employed in this study. By detailing the experimental procedures and analytical techniques, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the enhancements made to the MediaPipe framework for human pose estimation and evaluating their effectiveness.\n\n## 3.1. Research Design\n\nThe study employs an experimental research design to rigorously assess the enhancements made to the MediaPipe framework for human pose estimation. This design aims to evaluate the improved accuracy and efficiency of pose estimation across diverse and dynamically changing scenarios. Experiments are designed to mimic real-world applications, providing a robust test environment for the optimized MediaPipe framework.\n\n## 3.2. System Architecture\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the architecture of the video capture and processing system used in this study. The system is divided into several key components:\n\n- Video Capture: High-resolution cameras capture live video feeds processed in real-time by the Video Capture Module using OpenCV.\n\n- Pose Estimation Module: This module utilizes the optimized MediaPipe framework to analyze the video feed and accurately perform pose estimation. It incorporates advanced neural network algorithms tailored for dynamic pose detection.\n\n- Output Display: The processed video with overlaid pose estimations is displayed in real-time, providing immediate visual feedback.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\nA[Video Capture] --> B[Video Capture Module]\nB --> C[Pose Estimation Module]\nC --> D[Output Display]\nB -- uses OpenCV --> B\nC -- processes with MediaPipe --> C\nC -- Pose Detection --> C\nD -- shows detected poses --> D\n```\n\nFigure 1: System architecture of the video capture and processing pipeline used for human pose estimation.\n\n## 3.3. Angle Calculation\n\nOur pose estimation pipeline calculates the angle between three key points: shoulder, elbow, and wrist. The angle is computed using the arctangent function as follows:\n\n$$ angle = arctan2(c_y - b_y, c_x - b_x) - arctan2(a_y - b_y, a_x - b_x) $$\n\nwhere $(a_x, a_y)$, $(b_x, b_y)$, and $(c_x, c_y)$ represent the coordinates of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist landmarks, respectively. The resulting angle is converted from radians to degrees for further analysis.\n\nS. S. Sengar: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 2 of 6",

Study Implications and Relevance\n\nThe improvements made to the MediaPipe framework have significant practical implications, enhancing real-time applications in fields such as augmented reality, healthcare, and sports. By achieving higher accuracy and reduced processing time, the system provides more immersive experiences in augmented reality and allows for more effective monitoring and analysis in healthcare and sports settings. This research thus contributes to the field of computer vision by addressing key challenges in pose estimation, particularly in environments that require robust performance under dynamic conditions.\n\nFigure 3: Real-time pose estimation using the MediaPipe framework. Key points are accurately tracked and labelled, highlighting the system's effectiveness in dynamic conditions.\n\n### 5.2. Study Limitations and Bias Considerations\n\nDespite the promising results, this study is not without limitations. The experimental scenarios, though diverse, do not cover all possible real-world conditions, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the selection of datasets may introduce a bias, as certain types of movements or activities could be overrepresented. These factors must be carefully considered when interpreting the results and planning subsequent studies.\n\n## 4.3. Curl Counter Logic\n\nIn our curl counter logic, we determine the stage of the curl exercise based on the angle between the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. The stage is determined as follows:\n\n$$\n\\text{stage} = \\begin{cases}\n\\text{εdownε}, & \\text{if angle} > 160^\\circ \\\\\n\\text{εupε}, & \\text{if angle} < 30^\\circ \\text{ and previous_stage} = \\text{εdownε}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe curl counter is incremented when transitioning from the \"down\" stage to the \"up\" stage. This logic enables accurate tracking and counting of curl repetitions.\n\n## 4.4. Findings and Interpretations of Results\n\n### 4.4.1. Interpretation of Findings\n\nThe enhancements in both accuracy and computational speed are attributed to the refined algorithms and the incorporation of advanced neural network architectures within the MediaPipe framework. These improvements facilitate rapid and precise pose estimations, which are vital for applications requiring real-time data processing, such as augmented reality and interactive gaming.\n\n### 5.3. Directions for Future Research\n\nLooking ahead, it is crucial to extend the capabilities of the MediaPipe framework by integrating it with additional machine learning methodologies, such as reinforcement learning. This could potentially enable the system to adapt more dynamically to complex and unforeseen environments. Further research should also aim to reduce the computational resources required by the framework, thereby making it accessible on a wider range of devices, including those with lower processing power. Investigating these areas will help in overcoming the current limitations and enhance the framework's applicability and effectiveness in real-world applications.\n\n### 5.4. Ethical Considerations\n\nAs with any technological advancement, it is essential to consider the ethical implications of enhanced human\n\nS. S.
