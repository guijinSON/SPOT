In contrast, dynamic EMF undergoes temporal changes, leading to the emergence of electromagnetic radiation (EMR).9\n\nAn EMR is comprised of perpendicular electric and magnetic fields, moving through space at the speed of light and bearing both momentum and electromagnetic radiant energy.9 As shown in Fig. 1, the EMR spectrum encompasses sundry frequencies, including non-ionizing radiations, such as radio waves, infrared, visible light, and ultraviolet, and ionizing radiations, including X-rays and gamma rays. Various types of EMR play a distinct role within this spectrum of electromagnetic phenomena.9 Numerous studies have focused on electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EH),10 EMR impacts on immune dysfunction,11 neurological diseases,5,12,13 kidney damage,14 reproductive disorders,15 and genetic damage,16 for which notable debates are ongoing.\n\nEffect of RF-EMR exposure on nervous system functionality\nThe brain regulates cognitive and behavioral functions, and the extent of RF-EMR's impact on the brain, whether implicit or explicit, remains incompletely elucidated. Nonetheless, the effects of RF-EMR on living organisms can be categorized into two primary domains: thermal effects and non-thermal effects.18,19 Non-ionizing radiation interacts with matter and living organisms by producing dielectric heat.18,19 The radiation that enters the tissues is converted into heightened kinetic energy within the molecules that absorb it, increasing the tissue temperature. The degree of increase in temperature hinges on the amount of power absorbed by the tissues, which, in turn, is contingent on the tissue's absorption coefficient and inherent cooling mechanisms. Water plays a crucial role in the thermal absorption of radiation due to its high absorption coefficient.18,20 When the heat absorbed by the body or specific body parts surpasses its capacity to regulate temperature, it can damage tissue. These detrimental effects typically manifest when the absorbed power levels far exceed the body's metabolic capacity. As the absorbed energy increases, the biological mechanisms for temperature regulation gradually falter, ultimately leading to an uncontrollable escalation in body temperature and death. Michaelson et al provided demonstrations of these effects in dogs and rats.18,21\n\nThe absorption of radiation within the biological system exhibits variations contingent upon tissue characteristics. Tissues characterized by higher water content, such as skin, CNS, internal organs, and muscle display pronounced radiation absorption, impeding deep penetration. Conversely, tissues containing less water, such as bone and fat, exhibit a reduced capacity for radiation absorption.21 Some studies have asserted that RF-EMR exposure may affect metabolic processes in the\n\n|                                                        |                          |                      |\n| :----------------------------------------------------: | ------------------------ | -------------------: |\n|              **Electromagnetic spectrum**              |                          |                      |\n|                    Energy increase →                   |                          |                      |\n|                     Long wavelength                    |                          |     Short wavelength |\n| \\[Wavelength representation with increasing frequency] |                          |                      |\n|                   Buildings<br/>10⁷m                   | Humans<br/>1m            | Houseflies<br/>10⁵nm |\n|                   Pinpoint<br/>10⁴nm                   | Bacteria<br/>            |    Molecules<br/>1nm |\n|                    Atoms<br/>10⁻¹nm                    | Atomic nuclei<br/>10⁻⁵nm |                      |\n|                 10² Hz<br/>Radio waves                 | 10⁴ Hz                   |               10⁶ Hz |\n|                  10⁸ Hz<br/>Microwave                  | 10¹⁰ Hz                  | 10¹² Hz<br/>Infrared |\n|                 10¹⁶ Hz<br/>Ultraviolet                | 10¹⁸ Hz<br/>X-rays       |              10²² Hz |\n|                 10²⁴ Hz<br/>Gamma rays                 |                          |                      |\n|          600 nm      Visible light      450 nm         |                          |                      |\n|       4.3\\*10¹⁴ Hz                  6.6\\*10¹⁴ Hz       |                          |                      |\n\nFig. 1.

Conversely, tissues containing less water, such as bone and fat, exhibit a reduced capacity for radiation absorption.21 Some studies have asserted that RF-EMR exposure may affect metabolic processes in the\n\n|                                                        |                          |                      |\n| :----------------------------------------------------: | ------------------------ | -------------------: |\n|              **Electromagnetic spectrum**              |                          |                      |\n|                    Energy increase →                   |                          |                      |\n|                     Long wavelength                    |                          |     Short wavelength |\n| \\[Wavelength representation with increasing frequency] |                          |                      |\n|                   Buildings<br/>10⁷m                   | Humans<br/>1m            | Houseflies<br/>10⁵nm |\n|                   Pinpoint<br/>10⁴nm                   | Bacteria<br/>            |    Molecules<br/>1nm |\n|                    Atoms<br/>10⁻¹nm                    | Atomic nuclei<br/>10⁻⁵nm |                      |\n|                 10² Hz<br/>Radio waves                 | 10⁴ Hz                   |               10⁶ Hz |\n|                  10⁸ Hz<br/>Microwave                  | 10¹⁰ Hz                  | 10¹² Hz<br/>Infrared |\n|                 10¹⁶ Hz<br/>Ultraviolet                | 10¹⁸ Hz<br/>X-rays       |              10²² Hz |\n|                 10²⁴ Hz<br/>Gamma rays                 |                          |                      |\n|          600 nm      Visible light      450 nm         |                          |                      |\n|       4.3\\*10¹⁴ Hz                  6.6\\*10¹⁴ Hz       |                          |                      |",

Results from the radial maze test (RMT) indicate that the radiation did not affect the working memory.⁵⁵ Similarly, in a research conducted on rats by Son et al, exposure to 1950 MHz RF-EMR for a duration of 2 hours/day and 5 days/week for three months demonstrated no considerable change in working memory.⁵⁶ Dubreuil et al have observed that low SAR exposure levels had no impact on learning and memory in a head-only exposure approach.⁵⁷ Also, high SAR levels led to changes in certain exploratory activities.⁵⁷ RF-EMR exposure influences cognitive abilities, including memory loss and cognitive abilities in humans,⁵⁸ and animals.⁵⁹ But, there is no direct evidence for these effects.⁶⁰ Tattersall et al suggest that low-intensity RF-EMF radiation at 700 MHz may affect the hippocampus, leading to alterations in the electrical activity of hippocampal slices in rat brains.⁶¹ Moreover, Xu et al have noted that chronic exposure to 1800 MHz can lead to a reduction in excitatory synaptic activity in cultured hippocampal neurons.⁶² Kumlin et al have asserted that spatial memory performance was not changed in experiments conducted on young rats exposed to 900 MHz RF-EMR with 3 W/kg SAR level for five weeks.⁶³ On the other hand, Zhu et al exposed adult male Wistar rats to 1.5 GHz and 4.3 GHz RF-EMR, utilizing the experimental setup shown in Fig. 2, and concluded that the RF-EMR exposure may induce cognitive impairment and cause hippocampal tissue damage.⁶⁴ Moreover, when exposed to a combination of 1.5 GHz and 4.3 GHz RE-EMR, the damage was more severe, but frequency had no contribution to the gravity of the damages.⁶⁴\n\nRF-EMR exposure effects on neurotransmitters\nSeveral studies have focused on the effect of RF-EMR exposure on neurotransmitters in nervous systems. Neurotransmitters serve as pivotal mediators in neuronal communication, representing specialized molecules that are indispensable messengers in synaptic transmission. They exert a profound influence on cognitive and emotional behaviors, holding a pivotal role in brain development, encompassing neurotransmission, cellular differentiation, and the establishment of neural circuitry. Alterations in the concentrations of specific neurotransmitters are intimately linked to a spectrum of neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), schizophrenia, and depression.⁶⁰,⁶¹\n\nDopamine (DA) is a fundamental neurotransmitter found in the hypothalamus. It is also secreted from the pituitary gland,⁴,⁶⁵ playing a vital role as a precursor to norepinephrine. It is instrumental in a wide array of cerebral functions, including motor control, learning, executive functions, emotional regulation, and the processing of reward.⁴,⁶⁵,⁶⁶ Furthermore, DA has been implicated in several psychiatric and neurological disorders, notably PD.⁴,⁶⁷ In a study, Ezz et al exposed male adult rats to EMR with a SAR level of 0.845 W/kg and frequency of 1.8 GHz for a duration of 1 hour/day",

Results from the radial maze test (RMT) indicate that the radiation did not affect the working memory.⁵⁵ Similarly, in a research conducted on rats by Son et al, exposure to 1950 MHz RF-EMR for a duration of 2 hours/day and 5 days/week for three months demonstrated no considerable change in working memory.⁵⁶ Dubreuil et al have observed that low SAR exposure levels had no impact on learning and memory in a head-only exposure approach.⁵⁷ Also, high SAR levels led to changes in certain exploratory activities.⁵⁷ RF-EMR exposure influences cognitive abilities, including memory loss and cognitive abilities in humans,⁵⁸ and animals.⁵⁹ But, there is no direct evidence for these effects.⁶⁰ Tattersall et al suggest that low-intensity RF-EMF radiation at 700 MHz may affect the hippocampus, leading to alterations in the electrical activity of hippocampal slices in rat brains.⁶¹ Moreover, Xu et al have noted that chronic exposure to 1800 MHz can lead to a reduction in excitatory synaptic activity in cultured hippocampal neurons.⁶² Kumlin et al have asserted that spatial memory performance was not changed in experiments conducted on young rats exposed to 900 MHz RF-EMR with 3 W/kg SAR level for five weeks.⁶³ On the other hand, Zhu et al exposed adult male Wistar rats to 1.5 GHz and 4.3 GHz RF-EMR, utilizing the experimental setup shown in Fig. 2, and concluded that the RF-EMR exposure may induce cognitive impairment and cause hippocampal tissue damage.⁶⁴ Moreover, when exposed to a combination of 1.5 GHz and 4.3 GHz RE-EMR, the damage was more severe, but frequency had no contribution to the gravity of the damages.⁶⁴\n\nRF-EMR exposure effects on neurotransmitters\nSeveral studies have focused on the effect of RF-EMR exposure on neurotransmitters in nervous systems.

However, no significant changes in norepinephrine content were observed when the exposure intensity was 2 or 5 mW/cm².⁴⁷³ Several studies have investigated the effect of RF-EMR exposure on 5-Hydroxytryptamine (Serotonin), excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters, inhibitory neurotransmitters such as Acetylcholine, and peptide levels.⁴ A summary of RF-EMR exposure effects on CNS is depicted in Fig. 3.\n\n## Effect of RF-EMR exposure on oxidative stress and antioxidant defense system\n\nExposure to EMF exerts notable effects on living organisms, particularly pertaining to the intricate interplay of oxidants, antioxidants, and oxidative stress mechanisms.⁷⁶ Living organisms possess an antioxidant defense mechanism to counteract oxidative damage induced by free radicals. Nonetheless, the brain's high oxygen consumption renders it susceptible to reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, which impairs the CNS performance.⁷⁶ EMF exposure ought to disrupt this delicate balance between oxidants and antioxidants, leading to oxidative stress within the cellular milieu.⁷⁷\n\nExtensive experimental data from EMF exposure studies conducted on diverse living organisms have been diligently scrutinized to bolster this hypothesis.⁷² Oxidative stress, resulting from EMF exposure, holds potential detrimental implications for human health, given its influence on dynamic and non-linear biological pathways, magnifying the biochemical effects even with slight alterations in free radical concentrations.⁷⁸ Antioxidants influence biological systems via multiple mechanisms, including electron transfer, chelation of metal ions, cooperation as co-antioxidants, and the sustenance of gene expression regulation.⁷⁹\n\nGlutathione (GSH), an endogenous antioxidant, assumes a pivotal role in safeguarding cells against oxidative harm.⁷⁸⁸⁰ The tissue concentrations of GSH serve as a metric frequently employed to gauge the extent of radical-induced injury.⁸⁰⁸¹ Investigations have illuminated that exposure to RF-EMF can curtail GSH levels in cerebral tissue and the bloodstream.⁷⁹⁻⁸¹ Catalase (CAT), an enzymatic entity ubiquitous in oxygen-exposed organisms, operates by catalyzing the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and\n\n|                                                                                        |                        |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |\n| Ca²⁺ influx increase                                                                   |                        |\n| (leukemia T-cell; 50Hz)                                                                | (T-lymphocytes, 60 Hz) |\n| Cell growth inhibition (cancer cell, 60 Hz)                                            |                        |\n| Cell proliferation inhabitation (cancer cell, 27.12 MHz)                               |                        |\n| DNA break (900 MHZ,1.7 1.8, 2.45 Ghz)                                                  |                        |\n| Oxidative stress 900 MHZ                                                               |                        |\n| ROS generation (872,900 MHZ)                                                           |                        |\n| Protein misfolding (1.95 MHz)                                                          |                        |\n| Genotoxicity<br/>Cancer<br/>BBB<br/>Memory<br/>Neuronal activity<br/>Neurotransmitters |                        |\n\nFig. 3.

The results showed that prolonged exposure to ELF-EMF overnight results in a significant increase in the secretion of amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ), specifically the Aβ(1–42) isoform.

The extent of this impact was correlated with the magnetic intensity and duration of exposure to the fields.¹⁴⁶\n\nRecently, Burman et al investigated the effect of ELF-EMF on rat nervous systems by exposing C57BL/6NCrl and BALB/cAnNCrl rats to the spectrum of 5-100 Hz electric field with a power of 8.56 V/m r.m.s (on-state) and 4.99 V/m r.m.s (off-state) for 20 min/day, 25 days in phase one, and 60 min/day for 120 days in phase two.¹⁴⁷ No significant effects on the behavior or well-being of the subject were reported.¹⁴⁷ Further investigations on RF-EMR and ELF-EMF exposure effects on the rat and monkey CNS are summarized in Table 1.\n\n## Concluding Remarks\n\nIn today's world, electronic devices have become an integral part of modern society, with a significant increase in the demand for wireless communication technologies like smartphones. RF-EMR and ELF-EMF exposure exhibit positive, negative, and neutral effects, depending highly on EMF strengths, operational frequencies, and exposure times. Studies exploring the effects of electric, magnetic, and EMF on various biological processes have presented contradictory results. Although several investigations have indicated that RF-EMR may have carcinogenic effects, studying the epidemiology of neurodegenerative diseases is substantially more complicated than oncological diseases due to the complexities arising from non-specific symptoms. Multiple studies have reported adverse effects of RF-EMR exposure, including memory issues, learning issues, anxiety, impaired brain development, sleep problems, vertigo, tremors, and headaches for humans and animals. Based on various studies conducted on neurodegenerative diseases and hypotheses proposed by researchers, there are indications of a possible link between RF-EMR and the process of neurodegeneration. Many investigators affirmed that RF-EMR exposure could negatively affect the nervous system by influencing the antioxidant defense system, BBB permeability, neurotransmitter levels, neuronal calcium channels, structural properties of myelin proteins, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) related pathways, and metabolic processes. However, there is also evidence that RF-EMR exposure may be helpful for cognitive\n\nFig. 4. The magnetic field exposure system.
