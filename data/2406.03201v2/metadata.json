We investigate the \\(\\Lambda\\)-module structure of the Mordell-Weil group of an abelian variety over \\(\\mathbb{Z}_p\\)-extensions of \\( K \\), generalizing results due to Lee. Next, we study the algebraic structure and prove a control theorem for the \\(S\\)-fine Mordell-Weil groups, the function field analogue for Wuthrich's fine Mordell-Weil groups, over a \\(\\mathbb{Z}_p\\)-extension of \\( K \\). In case of the unramified \\(\\mathbb{Z}_p\\)-extension, \\( K_\\infty \\), we compute the characteristic ideal of the Pontryagin dual of the \\( S \\)-fine Mordell–Weil group. This provides an answer to an analogue of Greenberg’s question for the characteristic ideal of the dual fine Selmer group in the function field setup. In the \\( \\ell \\neq p \\) case, we prove the triviality of the \\(\\mu\\)-invariant for the Selmer group (same as the fine Selmer group in this case) of an elliptic curve over a non-commutative \\( GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}_\\ell) \\)-extension of \\( K \\) and thus extending Conjecture A.

[OT09, Theorem 1.7]).\n\nTherefore, a natural question is to find the characteristic ideal of R^S(E/K_∞). The first part of this article addresses this question.\n\nThe strategy of the proof is to define the S-fine Mordell-Weil group, M^S(E/L), for an algebraic extension L of K, following [Wut07] (cf. §2.3). The fine Selmer groups fits into the following short exact sequence:\n\n0 → M^S(A/L) → R^S(A/L) → Ж^S(A/L) → 0,\n\nwhere Ж^S(A/L) denotes the S-fine Tate-Shafarevich group (defined in §2.3). Note that the Ж^S(A/L) is the subgroup of the Ш(A/L)[p^∞], the p-primary part of the Tate-Shafarevich group (see Remark 2.7).\n\nFor each n ≥ 1, let Φ_n = ((1+T)^{p^n}-1)/((1+T)^{p^{n-1}}-1) ∈ Λ be the p^n-th cyclotomic polynomial in 1+T. Let K_n be the subextension of K_∞ such that [K_n : K] = p^n. One of the main result in the first part of our article is the following.\n\nTheorem 1.1. (Theorem 4.9) Let L be a finite extension of K. Let L_∞/L be the arithmetic Z_p-extension. Assume that E/L has split multiplicative reduction or good reduction at all primes of L and Ш(E/L_n)[p^∞] is finite for all n ≥ 0.\n\nAlso, suppose that E has split multiplicative reduction at all primes of S and that Ж^S(E/L_∞) is finite. Then,\n\nChar_Λ(R^S(E/L_∞)^∨) = ( ∏_{e_n≥1, n≥0} Φ_n^{e_n} )\n\nwhere e_n = (rank E(L_n) - rank E(L_{n-1})) / φ(p^n).\n\nThis theorem has the following applications.\n\nFirst, under the hypothesis that Ж^S(E/K_∞) is finite one can see easily that the μ-invariant of the S-fine Selmer group is trivial confirming the validity of Conjecture A in the function field case (cf. [GJS22, Theorem 3.7]).\n\nSecondly, one can deduce an algebraic functional equation of R^S(E/K_∞). More precisely, one obtains the following result.\n\nCorollary 1.2. Assume that the hypotheses in Theorem 1.1 hold. Then the characteristic ideals of R^S(E/K_∞)^∨ and R^S(E/K_∞)^{∨,ι} as Λ-modules are equal, i.e. there is a pseudo-isomorphism R^S(E/K_∞)^∨ ∼ R^S(E/K_∞)^{∨,ι}."

We don't know how to prove the result in Corollary 1.2 without the assumption that Ж^S(E/K∞) is finite. Even in the number field case over the cyclotomic Zₚ-extension of Q, such a result is not known without this additional hypothesis that Ж(E/Q_cyc) is finite (cf. [Lei23, discussion after Theorem C]). Infact, it is conjectured by Wuthrich that Ж(E/Q_cyc) should be finite [Wut07, Question 8.3 and Conjecture 8.4]. For classical p^∞-Selmer groups over Q∞, algebraic functional equations are known but the case of fine Selmer group is considered to be much more difficult and open as of now; partial results are proven in [HKLR23, Theorem C].\n\nRemark 1.4. Let Kₙ be the finite subextension of K∞ such that [Kₙ : K] = pⁿ. Then we know that eₙ = μ · pⁿ + λ · n + O(1) where |Ж^S(A/Kₙ)| = p^{eₙ}. Because of Conjecture A (which is true without the finiteness assumption of Ж^S(A/K∞)), we know that μ = 0. Additionally, if know that the growth of the Tate-Shafarevich group Ш(A/Kₙ)[p^∞] is of the kind p^{μ₁·pⁿ+c} (where c is a constant independent of n), then we can conclude that λ = 0 and hence the growth of Ж^S(A/Kₙ) stays bounded. In this case Ж^S(E/K∞) is finite.\n\nAn example arising via this technique in the number field case was given in [Wut07, page 11].\n\n1.2. Part II: Function Field (ℓ ≠ p case). Let ℓ be a rational prime, with ℓ ≠ p. Consider K = 𝔽(t), where 𝔽 is a finite field of char p. The ℓ^∞-Selmer group (defined in 2.8) of an elliptic curve E coincides with the ℓ^∞-fine Selmer group (defined in 2.8). The main result here is to prove an analogue of Conjecture A (i.e. the vanishing of the μ-invariant of the fine Selmer) over the non-commutative ℓ-adic trivializing extension K∞ of K. The Galois group of K∞ over K is an open subgroup of GL₂(Z_ℓ) (cf. [Pal14, §4]). In particular we show the following result.\n\nTheorem 1.5.

(i) In [LLS⁺21], the authors calculate the change in μ-invariant with isogeny for Selmer groups of elliptic curves having semi-stable reduction everywhere, for the unramified Zₚ-extension 𝐾_∞/𝐾.\n\nIn Theorem 5.1 we do not make any assumption about the nature of reduction of the elliptic curve and use a different method to calculate the change in μ-invariant with pʳ-isogeny of elliptic curves, with the additional assumption that H²_fl(𝐾_∞, 𝐸ᵢ[p^∞]) = 0. Infact our technique is much more general and can also be adapted in the ℓ ≠ p case both for the unramified cyclotomic Z_ℓ-extension and for a non-commutative GL₂(Z_ℓ) extension (see Appendix A). However we don’t get any new result in the ℓ ≠ p case because of the stronger result that we showed earlier concerning the triviality of the μ-invariant (see Theorem 1.5).\n\n(ii) The assumption H²_fl(𝐾_∞, 𝐸ᵢ[p^∞]) = 0, made in Theorem 5.1, is an analogue of the Weak-Leopoldt Conjecture for number fields. This assumption is similarly adopted in various other works (see for example [BV18, Remark 2.1]). We also rely on this assumption in our article; however, we are unable to provide a proof for it.\n\nIn the ℓ = p case, the Selmer group and the S-fine Selmer group over the unramified Zₚ-extension of 𝐾 are defined using flat-cohomology and hence the number field arguments doesn’t carry over verbatim in this setup. This is also reciprocated in the formula of the characteristic ideal of the fine S-Selmer group. We note that the power of Φₙ appearing in Theorem 1.1 is eₙ, unlike the number field case where the power is given by eₙ − 1 by Greenberg (cf. [KP07, Problem 0.7]). Furthermore, this difficulty also appears while analyzing the local terms in proving Theorem 5.1 (cf. see (10)). We overcame this difficulty"

For \\(v \\in S_\\text{un}\\), \\(\\ker(g_{3,v}) = 0\\), by arguments similar to Case 1. And for \\(v \\in S \\setminus S_\\text{un}\\), \\(\\ker(g_{3,v}) = \\prod_{w|v} H^1(K_{\\infty,w}, A)\\) and \\(\\text{coker}(g_{3,v}) \\subset \\prod_{w|v} H^2(K_{\\infty,w}, A)\\). As \\(\\text{cd}_\\ell(K_{\\infty,w}) = 1\\) ([NSW13, Theorem 7.1.8]), we get that \\(\\text{coker}(g_{3,v}) = 0\\). Therefore, \\(\\ker(g_3) = \\prod_{v \\in S \\setminus S_\\text{un}} \\ker(g_{3,v})\\) and \\(\\text{coker}(g_3) = 0\\).\n\nFor each prime \\(v \\in S\\) we fix a choice of prime \\(K_\\infty\\) lying above, which we will also denote by \\(v\\). It follows from Shapiro’s lemma that\n\n\\[\nH^j(G_\\infty, \\ker(g_{3,v})) \\cong H^j(G_{\\infty,v}, H^i(K_{\\infty,v}, A)).\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\n\\chi(G_\\infty, \\ker(\\varphi_3)) = \\prod_{v \\in S \\setminus S_\\text{un}} \\chi(G_{\\infty,v}, H^1(K_{\\infty,v}, A)).\n\\]\n\nAgain, using the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence, we obtain\n\n\\[\nH^i(G_{\\infty,v}, H^j(K_{\\infty,v}, A)) \\implies H^{i+j}(K_v, A)\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\chi(G_\\infty, \\ker(\\varphi_3))}{\\chi(G_\\infty, \\text{coker}(\\varphi_3))} = \\frac{1}{\\prod_{v \\in S \\setminus S_\\text{un}} \\chi(\\text{Gal}(\\overline{K_v}/K_v), A)}.\n\\]\n\nBy [Mil86, Chapter 1, Lemma 2.9], we know that \\(\\chi(\\text{Gal}(\\overline{K_v}/K_v), A) = 1\\). Moreover, using calculations similar to Case 1, we obtain that \\(\\frac{\\chi(G_\\infty, \\text{coker}(g_2))}{\\chi(G_\\infty, \\ker(g_2))} = 1\\).\n\nHence, in both cases, we obtain that \\(\\frac{\\chi(G, \\text{coker } g_1)}{\\chi(G, \\ker g_1)} = 1\\), for \\(G = G_\\infty\\) or \\(\\Gamma\\). This concludes the proof of the theorem.\n\n## Remark A.2.\n\n(i) For an arbitrary abelian variety \\(A\\), \\(S(A/K_\\text{cyc})^\\vee\\) is a finitely generated torsion \\(\\Lambda\\)-module [Pal14, Theorem 3.12].\n\n(ii) By [Wit20, Corollary 4.38], \\(S(E/K_\\text{cyc})^\\vee\\) is a finitely generated \\(\\mathbb{Z}_\\ell\\)-module, then by [Pal14, Theorem 4.4] \\(S(E/K_\\infty)^\\vee\\) is a torsion \\(\\Lambda(G)\\)-module.\n\n## References\n\n[BL09a] A.
