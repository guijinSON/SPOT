This effect is often referred to as higher free-space attenuation at higher frequencies.\n\nTo make up for the required link budget, i.e. the required antenna area, the common approach is to stack antenna elements into arrays in order to aggregate the effective antenna areas of the individual antenna elements. At the receiver this approach is equivalent to spatial beamforming.\n\nAt the transmitter, spatial beamforming is also an option, but not the only one. Though, it is the one option that dominates present day's literature. This work proposes a different option and wants to convince the reader of its many advantages compared to spatial beamforming at the transmitter. For that purpose, we take a holistic approach factoring in aspects of networking, information theory, digital communications, signal processing, and radio-frequency (RF) design.",

Some of them are more recommended than others. There is a common principle, though, that should be obeyed to create a favorable spectral shape: Do not rotate phase symmetrically.\n\nA phase shift is a temporary change of the instantaneous frequency towards either lower or higher values. As the instantaneous frequency is the temporal derivative of the phase, the phase shift is the integral of the",

Note that these two receive chains span twice as many dimensions in signal space.\nThis allows to implement frequency domain equalization of intersymbol interference [17] with only little noise\nenhancement similar to the reverse link of the 4G standard [18], [19]. These methods can be implemented at\nmoderate complexity [20].\n                                         V. NUMERICAL RESULTS\n        In the sequel, we provide a few examples of numerical results to demonstrate the quantitative potential of\nour concept. In all examples, we use direct phase injection.\nA. Spectral Mask of 5G Downlink\n               We target the spectral mask of 5G downlink at 100 MHz channel bandwidth. We choose a transmit array\nwith N = 16 antennas and QPSK modulation at a symbol rate of 5 Msymbols/s on each subcarrier resulting in\na total data rate of 160 Mbit/s. The corresponding symbol period is 200 ns. In order to cope with the spectral\nmask, we set T = 18.375. This results in a subcarrier spacing of 5.74 MHz. This is, by far, wide enough to be\ninsensitive to Doppler-induced frequency shifts.\n   1) Rectangular Pulse Shape:         We take a rectangular pulse of duration 21.8 ns and a ﬁrst order RC-lowpass\nﬁlter with cut-off frequency 50 MHz. The resulting instantaneous frequencies are shown in Fig. 1 for two\nsymbol periods and all 16 subcarriers. The instantaneous frequencies change over time, but they always keep\nbetween the lowest and highest subcarrier frequency. Changes are predominantly directed towards the center\nof the frequency band. The RC-lowpass ﬁlter distorts the rectangular pulses to an almost triangular shape and\nthe transition period extends signiﬁcantly beyond the duration of the pulse.\n          The four possible symbol transitions for the leftmost subcarrier are shown in Fig. 2 and compared to its\naverage. The transition starts at t = 200 ns. The phase is changed by temporarily lowering the frequency.\n           The average power spectral density (PSD) of the transmit signal is shown in Fig. 3. While the aggregate\nsignal is wideband, the transmit signal of any individual antenna element is narrowband. This simpliﬁes the",

This comes at the expense of multiple receiver chains of analog combining, A/D-conversion and FFT.\n\nEven for three or more separable propagation paths, two receiver chains are sufficient to equalize the resulting intersymbol interference. Note that these two receive chains span twice as many dimensions in signal space. This allows to implement frequency domain equalization of intersymbol interference [17] with only little noise enhancement similar to the reverse link of the 4G standard [18], [19]. These methods can be implemented at moderate complexity [20].\n\n## V. NUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nIn the sequel, we provide a few examples of numerical results to demonstrate the quantitative potential of our concept. In all examples, we use direct phase injection.\n\n### A. Spectral Mask of 5G Downlink\n\nWe target the spectral mask of 5G downlink at 100 MHz channel bandwidth. We choose a transmit array with N = 16 antennas and QPSK modulation at a symbol rate of 5 Msymbols/s on each subcarrier resulting in a total data rate of 160 Mbit/s. The corresponding symbol period is 200 ns. In order to cope with the spectral mask, we set T = 18.375. This results in a subcarrier spacing of 5.74 MHz. This is, by far, wide enough to be insensitive to Doppler-induced frequency shifts.\n\n1) Rectangular Pulse Shape: We take a rectangular pulse of duration 21.8 ns and a first order RC-lowpass filter with cut-off frequency 50 MHz. The resulting instantaneous frequencies are shown in Fig. 1 for two symbol periods and all 16 subcarriers. The instantaneous frequencies change over time, but they always keep between the lowest and highest subcarrier frequency. Changes are predominantly directed towards the center of the frequency band. The RC-lowpass filter distorts the rectangular pulses to an almost triangular shape and the transition period extends significantly beyond the duration of the pulse.\n\nThe four possible symbol transitions for the leftmost subcarrier are shown in Fig. 2 and compared to its average. The transition starts at t = 200 ns. The phase is changed by temporarily lowering the frequency.\n\nThe average power spectral density (PSD) of the transmit signal is shown in Fig. 3. While the aggregate signal is wideband, the transmit signal of any individual antenna element is narrowband. This simplifies the",

The resulting instantaneous frequencies\nare shown in Fig. 7 for two symbol periods. The RC-lowpass ﬁlter causes a minor distortion of the squared\nsine wave pulse. The average power spectral density (PSD) of the transmit signal is shown in Fig. 8. Above\n−50 dB, the PSD is hardly affected by the change of pulse waveform, cf. Fig. 3.

Even the spectrum of the centered carrier is not symmetric, as it performs phase shifts by −π, but not by +π. The overall spectrum shows significantly less sidelobes than the spectra of the individual subcarriers. This is a direct result of the in-band direction of the frequency deviations.\n\nThe real parts of the 16 average matched filters are depicted in Fig. 4. The envelope of the matched filters reflects the asymmetry of the rectangular pulse after distortion by the lowpass filter. The real parts of the 16 smoothly windowed FFT-based receive filters are depicted in Fig. 5. The windowing exponent significantly reduces the length of the window. The signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) is found as 9.7 dB and 18.3 dB for the average matched filter and the FFT-based receive filter, respectively. No Gaussian noise was added. Interference is solely due to crosstalk of subcarriers and intersymbol interference. The distribution of the interference is depicted Fig. 6 and found close to Gaussian.\n\nThe temporal combining gains of the two receive filters are 12.6 dB and 12.2 dB, respectively. The FFT-based receive filter has a slightly lower combining gain, as it windows the received signal more sharply. This compares favorably to the 12.0 dB combining gain of transmit beamforming with 16 antennas. Note that the temporal combining gain can exceed 12 dB as T = 18.375 > N = 16.\n\n2) Squared Sine Wave Pulse Shape: We take a squared sine wave pulse within [0; π] of duration 43.5 ns and a first order RC-lowpass filter with cut-off frequency 70 MHz. The resulting instantaneous frequencies are shown in Fig. 7 for two symbol periods. The RC-lowpass filter causes a minor distortion of the squared sine wave pulse. The average power spectral density (PSD) of the transmit signal is shown in Fig. 8. Above −50 dB, the PSD is hardly affected by the change of pulse waveform, cf. Fig. 3.

Spatial Multiplexing\n          Spatial multiplexing exploits unused antenna elements. If the link budget is better than expected, not all\ntransmit antennas are in need. Some of them can be used for spatial multiplexing. Spatial multiplexing converts\na linear increase in the number of antennas into a linear increase in data rate. The problem with spatial\nmultiplexing is twofold:\n  1) In oder to work at all, we either need near-ﬁeld communication or rich scattering.\n  2) Sophisticated signal processing effort is required at either transmitter or receiver.\nBoth issues are well studied in literature [16].\nC. Transmit Beamforming vs. MA-TISK\n            For transmit beamforming spatial multiplexing is only an option in the near-ﬁeld. Since narrow beams are\nformed at both transmitter and receiver, a rich scattering environment is very difﬁcult to exploit [9]. It does\nnot only require beam alignment for the direct signal path, but also for all the additional propagation paths.\nThe peak data rate of transmit beamforming is, thus, predominantly determined by the performance of higher\norder modulation. It is compromised by the inefﬁcient conversion of surplus antennas into surplus SNR which\nresults in only a logarithmic surplus of data rate.\n            MA-TISK can convert a linear increase in link-budget into a linear increase in data rate. The concept is\nbased on omni-directional radiation of signals. There is nothing that prevents rich scattering of the transmit\nsignal. For the implementation of Section IV, we propose to reduce the number of subcarriers and the duration\nbetween phase shifts to approximately half, a quarter, an eighth, etc. As a result, not all pulse waveforms will\nbe approximately orthogonal any longer. Pairs, quadruples, 8-tuples, etc. of them will be close to identical.\nHowever, for any pair or quadruple, we have two or four receive antennas to match them. In rich scattering or\nnear-ﬁeld scenarios, a multiplexing gain can be realized. This leads to a linear increase in data rate.",

While there are many works, on how to serve multiple users at various angular locations with transmit beamforming architectures, the most advanced and promising one is probably [25]. The architecture uses a reflect antenna, currently also often termed reflecting intelligent surface, in the near-field of few active transmitters. The near-field allows to separate users in both angle and distance.\n\nAt first sight, one could think that the angular separation is a feature that makes transmit beamforming superior to MA-TISK in terms of spectral efficiency, in particular, if there are many users to serve. However, that intuition is misguided. Such a system pays for serving K users with different data, instead of a single one, with a loss in beamforming gain by a factor of (at least) K, if the data rate per user stays fixed.1 There are simply (by a factor of K) fewer antennas available to form a beam towards an individual user. In MA-TISK, users cannot be separated spatially. However, we do not need to split our antennas among users, as they radiate in all directions. Therefore, we can split our subcarriers among users. The K users are separated in frequency. As each antenna corresponds to one subcarrier, this is, in fact, also a split of antennas. In contrast to transmit beamforming, users do not suffer from a loss of combining gain, but they suffer from a loss in data rate by a factor of K. For critical link-budget, however, a loss in data rate and a loss in beamforming gain are equivalent due to (10). Data rate can be converted into link-budget and vice versa. This can be realized, e.g., by adapting the rate of the error correction code by a factor of K. We conclude that the overall performance in terms of rate per user and link-budget will be similar, if the system parameters are properly designed.\n\n1Alternatively, the system could also pay by a factor of K in data rate, if the beamforming gain stays fixed, e.g., serving the users in time multiplex.

CONCLUSIONS\n                                    Due to a space-time transmit signal matrix with full rank, coherent combining can be performed at any\n                          receiver side, irrespective of location. This avoids the need for beamforming at the transmitter and makes beam\nalignment obsolete.\n                            Phase shifts are induced by steering voltage-controlled oscillators. This avoids insertion losses that occur,\nwhen a common power ampliﬁer drives multiple antennas.\n  Each of the N     antenna elements operates only at about (1/N)th                                 of the channel bandwidth. So does the\n                              corresponding power oscillator, the cables, and connectors. Narrowband RF hardware is generally less costly\nthan wideband equipment.\n                              The transmit signals have perfect constant envelope. This allows power-efﬁcient and cost-effective RF hard-\n                             ware. This is possible despite the limitations of Heisenberg’s time-frequency uncertainty, as the frequency-\nconstraint is not per antenna, but only for the aggregate spectrum of all antennas.\n                             The signal is radiated omnidirectionally in space. There are no areas with critical electromagnetic compati-\nbility, as coherent signal combining only occurs within the receiver.\n                             Diversity is fully exploited in both space, time, and frequency. Although the signals at individual antennas\n                               are narrowband, forward-error correction coding can span over the data symbols of multiple antennas. Thus,\n                     frequency diversity can be fully exploited. Temporal and spatial diversity is fully exploited as the transmit signal\nis sent omni-directionally, allowing for multi-path propagation without angular restrictions.\n                            The transmitter does not require explicit D/A-converters. It can directly feed the data symbols into the VCO.\n                                 The transmit signal is inherently cyclo-stationary.

          "md": "VIII. CONCLUSIONS\n\nDue to a space-time transmit signal matrix with full rank, coherent combining can be performed at any receiver side, irrespective of location. This avoids the need for beamforming at the transmitter and makes beam alignment obsolete.\n\nPhase shifts are induced by steering voltage-controlled oscillators. This avoids insertion losses that occur, when a common power amplifier drives multiple antennas.\n\nEach of the N antenna elements operates only at about (1/N)th of the channel bandwidth. So does the corresponding power oscillator, the cables, and connectors. Narrowband RF hardware is generally less costly than wideband equipment.\n\nThe transmit signals have perfect constant envelope. This allows power-efficient and cost-effective RF hardware. This is possible despite the limitations of Heisenberg's time-frequency uncertainty, as the frequency-constraint is not per antenna, but only for the aggregate spectrum of all antennas.\n\nThe signal is radiated omnidirectionally in space. There are no areas with critical electromagnetic compatibility, as coherent signal combining only occurs within the receiver.\n\nDiversity is fully exploited in both space, time, and frequency. Although the signals at individual antennas are narrowband, forward-error correction coding can span over the data symbols of multiple antennas. Thus, frequency diversity can be fully exploited. Temporal and spatial diversity is fully exploited as the transmit signal is sent omni-directionally, allowing for multi-path propagation without angular restrictions.\n\nThe transmitter does not require explicit D/A-converters. It can directly feed the data symbols into the VCO. The transmit signal is inherently cyclo-stationary. This simplifies synchronization and reduces signaling overhead.\n\nPeak data rate can be made to grow linearly with SNR by means of spatial multiplexing even in far fields scenarios, since omni-directional transmission does not prevent rich scattering.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nThe author would like to thank Martin Vossiek, Christian Carlowitz, and Leonhard Hahn for helpful discussions on millimeter wave circuitry, in general, and SILOs, in particular.
