In the next theorem we compute the second Betti number of Shafarevich–Tate twists.

Many results in Section 2 were contained in our previous work [AR21] but were stated assuming that the base B of a Lagrangian fibration π is smooth and π has no multiple fibers in codimension one. We show that these assumptions are not necessary. In Section 3 we will prove the second part of Theorem A, which is easier than the first part. The first part of Theorem A will be proven in Section 4. In Section 5 we study cohomological properties of Shafarevich–Tate twists. We will see that Shafarevich–Tate twists have trivial first cohomology in Subsection 5.1 and prove that H^0(Ω^2_{X^φ}) is one-dimensional in Subsection 5.2. These two statements immediately imply Theorem B. Finally, in Subsection 5.3 we prove Theorem C and then show how to derive Theorem D from Theorem C.\n\n1.2.6. **Acknowledgements.** I thank my advisor Giulia Saccà as well as (in alphabetical order) Rodion Déev, Daniel Huybrechts, Yoon-Joo Kim, Nikita Klemyatin, Morena Porzio, Evgeny Shinder, Sasha Viktorova, and Claire Voisin for their interest and helpful conversations.

Then there exists an integral symmetric non-degenerate form q on H²(X) such that ∀α ∈ H²(X, ℤ),\n\nc_X q(α)^n = ∫_X α^{2n}.\n\nThe constant c_X is positive and depends only on the deformation type of X.\n\nRemark 2.1.3. The integral form q from Theorem 2.1.2 is uniquely defined if we require it to be non-divisible.\n\nDefinition 2.1.4. The form q from Theorem 2.1.2 is called the Beauville–Bogomolov–Fujiki form or BBF form.\n\n2.1.5. Fibers of Lagrangian fibrations are abelian varieties. Consider a Lagrangian fibration π: X → B (Definition 1.1.2) on an irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifold X. A general fiber of π is a complex torus and even an abelian variety [Cam06]. The projectivity of smooth fibers follows easily from the theorem below.\n\nTheorem 2.1.6 ([Voi92, Mat99]). Let π: X → B be a Lagrangian fibration on a hyperkähler manifold and F its smooth fiber. Then the restriction map\n\nH²(X, ℚ) → H²(F, ℚ)\n\nhas rank one.\n\nThanks to Theorem 2.1.6, for any Kähler class h ∈ H²(X, ℝ) some real multiple c · h of h restricts to an integral class on F. The class c · h|_F is Kähler and integral, hence ample. It follows that F is indeed an abelian variety.\n\n2.1.7. Discriminant. The image in B of singular fibers of π is called the discriminant of the Lagrangian fibration and will be denoted by Δ. It is known to be a divisor [HO09, Proposition 3.1]. We define B° to be the complement of Δ and X° := π⁻¹(B°).\n\n2.1.8. Vertical vector fields. The holomorphic symplectic form σ enables us to construct a lot of vertical vector fields on X. First, it induces an isomorphism Ω_X →^{ι_σ} T_X. Let X' denote the subset π⁻¹(B^reg) ⊂ X. Consider the composition of maps\n\nπ^*Ω_{B^reg} → Ω_{X'} →^{ι_σ} T_{X'} → π^*T_{B^reg}.\n\nIt is easy to see that it vanishes on X°. Indeed, for every form α on an open subset of the base, the vector field dual to π^*α is tangent to smooth fibers of π. Since π^*T_{B^reg} is locally free, the map π^*Ω_{B^reg} → π^*T_{B^reg} vanishes on X'. Therefore, the map ι_σ sends π^*Ω_{B^reg} into T_{X'/B^reg} (Definition 1.1.3). By taking pushforwards to B^reg we obtain a map\n\nπ_*π^*Ω_{B^reg} → π_*T_{X'/B^reg}.\n\nBy [Mat99] π_*𝒪_X ≅ 𝒪_B. The projection formula implies that π_*π^*Ω_{B^reg} ≅ Ω_{B^reg}, and we get a map:\n\nΩ_{B^reg} → π_*T_{X'/B^reg}. (2)\n\nThe sheaf T_{X/B} is the kernel of the map T_X → π^*T_B / Tors(π^*T_B) (Definition 1.1.3). The kernel of a map of a reflexive sheaf to a torsion-free sheaf is a reflexive sheaf, hence T_{X/B} is reflexive. The pushforward of a reflexive sheaf along an equidimensional morphism is reflexive [Har80, Corollary 1.7], hence π_*T_{X/B} is reflexive as well. Therefore, the map (2) extends to a map\n\nι_σ : Ω_B^{[1]} → π_*T_{X/B}. (3)\n\nHere Ω_B^{[1]} denotes the sheaf of reflexive differentials on B, i.e., the double dual of Ω_B. Equivalently, Ω_B^{[1]} := j_*Ω_{B^reg}, where j: B^reg ↪ B is the embedding of the smooth locus of B into B. Similarly, we define Ω_B^{[i]} as j_*Ω_{B^reg}^i."

We showed this fact in [AR21, Theorem 2.6] assuming that \\(B\\) is smooth and the fibration \\(\\pi\\) has no multiple fibers in codimension one. These assumptions are not necessary, as we will see very soon. The proof relies on the following elementary lemma.\n\nLemma 2.1.10. Let \\(\\pi: Y \\rightarrow S\\) be a flat morphism of finite type of possibly non-compact complex manifolds. As before, denote by \\(S^\\circ\\) the image of smooth fibers of \\(\\pi\\) and by \\(Y^\\circ\\) the preimage of \\(S^\\circ\\) in \\(Y\\).

Then the form \\(\\beta^\\circ\\) extends to a holomorphic k-form \\(\\beta\\) on \\(S\\) and \\(\\alpha = \\pi^* \\beta\\).\n\nProof. Suppose that \\(\\alpha|_{\\pi^{-1}(S')}\\) = \\(\\pi^* \\beta'\\) for some form \\(\\beta'\\) on an open subset \\(S' \\subset S\\) with complement of codimension at least two. Then we are done. Indeed, by Hartogs theorem \\(\\beta'\\) extends to a holomorphic form \\(\\beta\\) on \\(S\\). The forms \\(\\pi^* \\beta\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) coincide on an open subset, hence they coincide on \\(Y\\). Therefore, it is enough to prove the statement for some \\(S' \\subset S\\) as above.\n\nIf \\(\\mathrm{codim}\\; \\Delta \\geq 2\\), then we are done, so let us assume that \\(\\mathrm{codim}\\; \\Delta = 1\\). Pick a general point \\(b \\in \\Delta\\). Let \\(U\\) be a neighborhood of \\(b\\). It is enough to show that \\(\\beta^\\circ\\) extends to a holomorphic form on \\(U\\). The fibration \\(\\pi\\) might not admit a local section in a neighborhood \\(U\\) of \\(b\\); yet, for some finite cover \\(f: V \\rightarrow U\\) ramified in \\(\\Delta \\cap U\\), the base change morphism \\(\\pi_V: X_V \\rightarrow V\\) of \\(\\pi\\) to \\(V\\) admits a section.

Therefore \\(f^* \\beta^\\circ\\) can be extended to a form \\(\\beta_V := s^* F^* \\alpha\\) on \\(V\\). As we will see in a moment, this implies that \\(\\beta^\\circ\\) extends to a holomorphic form on \\(U\\). Indeed, choose coordinates \\((t, z_1, \\ldots, z_{n-1})\\) on \\(U\\) and \\((s, z_1, \\ldots, z_{n-1})\\) on \\(V\\) such that \\(\\Delta \\cap U = \\{t = 0\\}\\) and the map \\(f\\) sends \\((s, z_1, \\ldots, z_{n-1})\\) to \\((s^k, z_1, \\ldots, z_{n-1})\\).

Then\n\\[\nf^* \\beta^\\circ = k h(s^k, z) s^{k-1} ds + \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} h_i dz_i.\n\\]\nThe form \\(f^* \\beta^\\circ\\) extends to a holomorphic form on \\(V\\). Hence the functions \\(h_i\\)'s extend to holomorphic functions on \\(V\\). They are bounded on \\(V\\), hence bounded on \\(U\\). Therefore, \\(h_i\\)'s extend to holomorphic functions on \\(U\\). The function \\(h(s^k, z) s^{k-1}\\) is also bounded, hence so is\n\\[\nh(t, z)t = h(s^k, z)s^k.\n\\]\nTherefore, \\(h\\) has at worst a simple pole at \\(\\Delta\\). But the form\n\\[\nf^* \\frac{dt}{t} = k \\frac{ds}{s},\n\\]\nis not holomorphic. Hence \\(h\\) is actually holomorphic on \\(U\\).

This map is definitely an isomorphism over \\(B^\\circ\\) and is injective (2.1.8). It is enough to show that it is surjective. Let \\(v\\) be a vertical vector field over an open subset \\(U \\subset B\\). Then the form \\(\\iota_v \\sigma\\) equals \\(\\pi^*\\beta^\\circ\\) for some holomorphic 1-form \\(\\beta^\\circ\\) on \\(B^\\circ \\cap U\\).

It follows from Corollary 2.1.14 that the sheaves \\(R^i\\pi_*\\mathcal{O}_X\\) are locally free on \\(B^{reg}\\). The base change theorem [Mum12, Chapter 5, Corollary 2&3] implies that for all points \\(b \\in B^{reg}\\) the dimension of \\(H^i(\\mathcal{O}_{\\pi^{-1}(b)})\\) does not depend on \\(b\\).

Then the cohomology groups \\(H^j(B, \\Omega_B^{[i]})\\) are the same as for \\(B = \\mathbb{P}^n\\).\n\nProof. Step 1. By Corollary 2.1.14, \\(H^j(\\Omega_B^{[i]}) \\simeq H^j(R^i\\pi_*\\mathcal{O}_X)\\). It follows from a result by Kollár [Kol86, p.172] that\n\\[\nR\\pi_*\\mathcal{O}_X \\simeq \\bigoplus R^i\\pi_*\\mathcal{O}_X[-i].\n\\]\nTherefore the Leray spectral sequence for \\(\\mathcal{O}_X\\) degenerates on \\(E^2\\) and\n\\[\nh^{0,k}(X) = \\sum_{i=0}^k h^{k-i}(R^i\\pi_*\\mathcal{O}_X).\n\\]\n\nWhen \\(k\\) is odd \\(h^{0,k} = 0\\) and when \\(k\\) is even \\(h^{0,k} = 1\\).

Consider the filtration \\(F^i H^{0,k}(X)\\) on \\(H^{0,k}(X)\\) induced by the Leray spectral sequence. First, consider the case \\(k = 2\\). The cohomology group \\(H^{0,2}(X)\\) is generated by \\(\\sigma\\).

Degenerate twistor deformations.\n\nThere is a useful differential geometric point of view on Shafarevich–Tate deformations [AR21, Subsection 2.3]. Let σ be a holomorphic symplectic form on X and α be a closed (1,1)-form on B. The form σ + tπ*α is obviously not holomorphic, but it turns out that there exists a different complex structure Iₜ on X making σ + tπ*α holomorphic symplectic [SV24, Section 2.2]. Moreover, such a complex structure is unique.\n\nDefinition 2.2.3. Denote by Xₜ the manifold X with the new complex structure Iₜ.

(Subsection 4.5). We will see in Proposition 4.5.1 that the family \\(\\mathcal{Y} \\to \\mathbb{D}\\) is a Shafarevich–Tate family after restriction to some open dense subset \\(V \\subset U\\). Moreover, it will turn out that the base \\(B'\\) of the Lagrangian fibration \\(p_t: \\mathcal{Y}_t \\to B'\\) for t ∈ V is isomorphic to B (Proposition 4.5.2).\n\nStep 4. \\(\\mathcal{Y}_0\\) is bimeromorphic to a degenerate twistor deformation of \\(\\mathcal{Y}_t\\). (Subsection 4.6). Let \\(\\mathcal{Y}' \\to \\mathbb{D}\\) be the Shafarevich–Tate family of a Lagrangian fibration \\(p_\\tau : \\mathcal{Y}_\\tau \\to B\\) for some τ ∈ V. By the previous step, \\(\\mathcal{Y}_t \\simeq \\mathcal{Y}'_t\\) for all t ∈ V. Essentially the same argument as the one used by Perego in his proof of [Per17, Lemma 2.6] will show that \\(\\mathcal{Y} := \\mathcal{Y}_0\\) is bimeromorphic to \\(\\mathcal{Y}' := \\mathcal{Y}'_0\\) (Lemma 4.6.1). Therefore, \\(\\mathcal{Y}'\\) is of Fujiki class C.\n\nStep 5. Shafarevich–Tate deformations of bimeromorphic Lagrangian fibrations are bimeromorphic. (Subsection 4.7). We saw in Step 2 that the Lagrangian fibrations \\(X_t\\) and \\(\\mathcal{Y}_t = \\mathcal{Y}'_t\\) are bimeromorphic for some t ∈ V. We will see in 4.7.1 that all Shafarevich–Tate deformations of \\(X_t\\) and \\(\\mathcal{Y}'_t\\) are bimeromorphic. Therefore, X is bimeromorphic to \\(\\mathcal{Y}'\\), which is in its turn bimeromorphic to a hyperkähler manifold \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) (Corollary 4.7.3). Hence X is of Fujiki class C.\n\nStep 6. Criterion for Kählerness. (Subsection 4.8). Perego discovered in [Per17, Theorem 1.15] a cohomological criterion for Kählerness of limits of hyperkähler manifolds which are of Fujiki class C. We will check that the assumptions of Perego’s criterion are satisfied for Shafarevich–Tate twists and will conclude that X is hyperkähler (Proposition 4.8.3).\n\n4.3.1. Period map for hyperkähler manifolds. Let X be a hyperkähler manifold and Λ be a lattice isomorphic to the lattice (H²(X, ℤ), q_X), where q_X is the BBF form (Definition 2.1.4). Denote Λ_ℂ := Λ ⊗ ℂ.\n\nDefinition 4.3.2. The moduli space \\(\\mathcal{M}_\\Lambda\\) of Λ-marked hyperkähler manifolds is the moduli space of pairs (Y, g) where Y is a hyperkähler manifold and \\(g: H^2(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\Lambda\\) is an isomorphism of lattices.\n\nDefinition 4.3.3. The period map\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Per}: \\mathcal{M}_\\Lambda \\to \\mathbb{P}(\\Lambda_\\mathbb{C})\n\\]\nsends the point of \\(\\mathcal{M}_\\Lambda\\) corresponding to a pair (Y, g) to the class of the line \\(g(H^{2,0}(Y)) \\subset \\Lambda_\\mathbb{C}\\). The image of a pair (Y, g) under the period map is called its period."

Hence \\( B \\simeq B' \\). \\(\\square\\)\n\nThe two propositions of this subsection complete the proof of Step 3 (4.2) of Proposition 4.0.1.\n\nThe images under the period map (Definition 4.3.3) of all three families coincide.\n\nConsider the following three families of irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds:\n\n**Lemma 4.6.1.** The holomorphic symplectic manifolds \\( Y := Y_0 \\) and \\( Y' := Y'_0 \\) are bimeromorphic.\n\n*Proof.* The proof of this lemma follows closely the second part of the proof of [Per17, Lemma 2.6]. First, since \\( Y_t \\) is Kähler for all \\( t \\in \\mathbb{D} \\), we can find a family \\( \\{ \\beta_t \\}_{t \\in \\mathbb{D}} \\) of Kähler forms on \\( Y_t \\). Second, we can find a family of \\( d \\)-closed \\( (1, 1) \\)-forms \\( \\{ \\alpha_t \\}_{t \\in \\mathbb{D}} \\) such that \\( [\\alpha_t] \\) intersects positively all rational curves in fibers of the Lagrangian fibration \\( p_t : Y'_t \\to B' \\). It is possible to find such \\( \\{ \\alpha_t \\}_{t \\in \\mathbb{D}} \\) because \\( Y'_t \\) is a Shafarevich–Tate deformation and fibers of \\( p_t \\) are the same for all \\( t \\). Moreover, we can suppose that \\( q([\\alpha_t]) > 0 \\) \\( \\forall t \\) up to possibly shrinking \\( \\mathbb{D} \\).\n\nBy Lemma 4.4.1, for a very general \\( t \\in V \\), all rational curves on \\( Y'_t \\) are contained in fibers of \\( p_t \\). Hence the class \\( [\\alpha_t] \\) intersects all rational curves on \\( Y'_t \\) positively and has positive square with respect to the BBF form. By [Bou01], \\( [\\alpha_t] \\) or \\( -[\\alpha_t] \\) is a Kähler class.\n\nUp to changing the sign of \\( \\alpha_t \\) we can assume that \\( [\\alpha_t] \\) is a Kähler class on \\( Y'_t \\) for a very general \\( t \\in V \\). Since Kählerness is an open property, we conclude that \\( [\\alpha_t] \\) is a Kähler class for all \\( t \\in V' \\), where \\( V' \\subset V \\) is a dense open subset of \\( V \\). Therefore, there exists a family of forms \\( \\{ \\alpha_t \\} \\) on \\( Y'_t \\) such that the form \\( \\alpha_t \\) is Kähler for all \\( t \\in V' \\).\n\nWe conclude that there exists a sequence \\( \\{ t_m \\}_{m \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\) of points in \\( V \\) which converges to \\( 0 \\), and such that for every \\( m \\in \\mathbb{N} \\), we have a Kähler form \\( \\alpha_m := \\alpha_{t_m} \\) on \\( Y'_m := Y'_{t_m} \\) and a Kähler form \\( \\beta_m := \\beta_{t_m} \\) on \\( Y_m := Y_{t_m} \\), such that the sequence \\( \\{ \\alpha_m \\} \\) converges to \\( \\alpha_0 \\) and \\( \\{ \\beta_m \\} \\) converges to \\( \\beta_0 \\).\n\nIntroduce \\( \\Lambda \\)-markings \\( g_t : H^2(Y_t) \\to \\Lambda \\) and \\( g'_t : H^2(Y'_t) \\to \\Lambda \\) on \\( Y_t \\) and \\( Y'_t \\) respectively.

By Bishop's Theorem [Bis64] (see also [BR75, Lemma 5.1]), the cycles Γm converge to a cycle Γ ⊂ Y′0 × Y0. Next, we need to show that Γ contains an irreducible component of a graph of a bimeromorphism. The proof follows word by word the argument in [Per17, Lemma 2.6] (see also the proof of [Huy99, Theorem 4.3])\n\nLemma 4.6.1 concludes Step 4 (4.2) of the proof of Proposition 4.0.1.\n\nProposition 4.7.1. Let π : X → B and p : Y → B be two Lagrangian fibrations on irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds X and Y. Suppose that there is a bimeromorphic map f : X --→ Y which commutes with the Lagrangian fibrations. Fix a Kähler form α on B and consider the degenerate twistor deformations Xt and Yt corresponding to α (Definition 2.2.3). Then there exists a bimeromorphism ft : Xt --→ Yt which commutes with the Lagrangian fibrations on Xt and Yt.\n\nProof. Consider the graph Γ ⊂ X × Y of the bimeromorphism f. It is a Lagrangian subvariety of X × Y with respect to the holomorphic symplectic form P_X*σ_X - P_Y*σ_Y, where P_X and P_Y are projections of X × Y on X and Y respectively and σ_X, σ_Y are holomorphic symplectic forms on X and Y respectively. It is assumed that f*σ_Y = σ_X. The form P_X*π_X*α - P_Y*π_Y*α vanishes on Γ. Therefore Γ is Lagrangian with respect to a form\n\n$$\nP_X^*(\\sigma_X + t \\pi_X^* \\alpha) - P_Y^*(\\sigma_Y + t \\pi_Y^* \\alpha)\n$$\n\nfor any t ∈ ℂ. Consider the complex structures I_t on X_t and J_t on Y_t induced by holomorphic symplectic forms σ_X + tπ_X*α and σ_Y + tπ_Y*α (see 2.2.2). The form (8) is holomorphic symplectic with respect to the complex structure (I_t, J_t) on X × Y. In other words, the form (8) is holomorphic symplectic on X_t × Y_t. A Lagrangian submanifold of a holomorphic symplectic manifold is necessarily complex. This is an immediate consequence of the following linear algebraic fact: a real subspace of a complex vector space which is Lagrangian with respect to a holomorphic symplectic form is complex. A priori Γ is only a real analytic subvariety of X_t × Y_t, but it must be complex analytic in its smooth points because it is Lagrangian. By [Rei70] (see also [Kur]) Γ_t is a complex analytic subvariety of X_t × Y_t. It induces a desired bimeromorphism f_t : X_t --→ Y_t.\n\nRemark 4.7.2. The proof of Proposition 4.7.1 shows that the bimeromorphism f_t : X_t --→ Y_t is the same as f : X --→ Y real analytically.\n\nCorollary 4.7.3. Let X → 𝔻 be a Shafarevich–Tate family as in Proposition 4.0.1. Then X = X0 is bimeromorphic to a hyperkähler manifold, in particular, is of Fujiki class C.\n\nProof. Consider the Shafarevich–Tate family Y′ → 𝔻 introduced in Subsection 4.6. For every t ∈ V ⊂ 𝔻 the manifold Y′_t admits a Lagrangian fibration p′_t : Y′_t → B over the same base as X_t (Proposition 4.5.2) and the manifolds Y′_t and X_t are bimeromorphic as Lagrangian fibrations. Proposition 4.7.1 implies that all degenerate twistor deformations of X_t and Y′_t are bimeromorphic. In particular, X = X_0 is bimeromorphic to Y′ := Y′_0. By Lemma 4.6.1 the manifold Y′ is bimeromorphic to Y. Hence X is bimeromorphic to the hyperkähler manifold Y.\n\nWe completed the proof of Step 5 (4.2)."

Assume that there is a class β ∈ H¹,¹(X) satisfying the following properties:\n\n1. q(β) > 0;\n2. β · C > 0 for any rational curve C ⊂ X;\n3. q(β, ξ) ≠ 0 for any non-zero ξ ∈ NS(X).\n\nThen X is hyperkähler and β is a Kähler class on X⁴.\n\nPerego’s result easily implies the following criterion for Kählerness. Before stating it, let us recall that the Mori cone of a compact complex manifold X is the cone NE(X) ⊂ H₂(X, ℝ) generated by classes of curves on X. For any morphism X → Y we define the relative Mori cone NE(X/Y) ⊂ H₂(X, ℝ) as the cone generated by classes of curves contained in fibers of X → Y.\n\nCorollary 4.8.2. Let X be a compact holomorphic symplectic manifold of Fujiki class C which is a limit of hyperkähler manifolds.

There is a neighborhood U of β inside H¹,¹(X) such that every β′ ∈ U satisfies the assumptions of the corollary. A very general β′ ∈ U does not lie in 𝔚. Theorem 4.8.1 implies that X is hyperkähler. A class β ∈ H¹,¹(X) on a hyperkähler manifold X is Kähler if and only if it satisfies the two assumptions of the corollary [Bou01, Théorème 1.2] (see also [Huy03, Proposition 3.2]), hence β is a Kähler class. □\n\nProposition 4.8.3.

As before, we denote by η the pullback of an ample class on B to X. If NS(X) ⊄ η^⊥, then X is projective (Theorem 3.0.7), and we are done. Hence we may assume that NS(X) ⊂ η^⊥. In this case NE(X/Y) = NE(X) by Lemma 4.4.1. By Corollary 4.8.2 it is enough to construct a class β ∈ H¹,¹(X) such that q(β) > 0 and β · c > 0 for any class c ∈ NE(X/Y).\n\nPick a Kähler class β′′ on H²(X_t) for some t ∈ U. Then β′′ · c > 0 for any class c ∈ NE(X/Y). Identify H²(X_t) and H²(X) using the Gauss-Manin connection. The classes of horizontal curves on X_t will get identified with classes of horizontal curves on X. Let β′ be the (1,1)-part of β′′ considered as a class in H²(X). Since every class in H²,⁰(X) and H⁰,²(X) restricts trivially to any curve on X, the class β′ satisfies the second condition of Corollary 4.8.2. Define β := β′ + kη for k ≫ 0. Then\n\nq(β) = q(β′) + 2kq(β′, η),\n\nwhich is positive for sufficiently big k. The class β ∈ H²(X) satisfies both conditions of Corollary 4.8.2, hence X is hyperkähler. □"

As explained in the beginning of Section 4, Theorem A follows easily from Proposition 4.0.1. The proof of Proposition 4.0.1 follows the steps outlined in Subsection 4.2. We are done with all of them by now. We started with a Shafarevich–Tate family \\(\\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathbb{D}\\) satisfying the conditions of Proposition 4.0.1.

The restriction of ξ to every smooth fiber is d-closed because all holomorphic forms on Kähler manifolds are closed. Therefore, ξ defines a section of the local system R²π_*ℂ |_{B⁰}. By 5.0.2 this local system has just one non-trivial section, which is the class of a form of type (1, 1). The class [ξ|_F] is of type (2, 0), hence it must be trivial.

Consider the map\n\nι_ξ : T_{Y/S} → Ω_Y\n\nsending a vector field v to ι_v ξ. As before, denote by Y⁰ the union of smooth fibers of π and S⁰ := π(Y⁰). For every vertical vector field v, the restriction of ι_v ξ to Y⁰ lies in π^*Ω_{S⁰} because ξ|_F = 0 for every smooth fiber F.
