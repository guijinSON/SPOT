A significant amount of energy is converted into heat rather than being radiated. Amplifiers which can cope with amplitude variations are also more expensive than their counterparts that can only cope with phase changes.\n\nNevertheless, linear modulation has displaced their nonlinear counterparts like continuous phase modulation and frequency shift keying over the evolution of wireless standard from 1G to 5G. This was, as frequency shift keying comes with its own severe issues: 1) The spectrum is poorly confined. 2) The amplitude domain is not utilized for data transmission. Both effects result in poor spectral efficiency.\n\nIn a multi-carrier system with low-rate repetition coding, the negative issues of frequency shift keying, if properly designed, vanish, while the crest problems of linear modulation remain. This makes continuous-phase frequency shift keying (CPFSK) a promising candidate for communication in millimeter and terahertz bands.",

For the complex-valued AWGN channel, the relation is well-investigated and given by\n\n$$R = \\log_2(1 + \\text{SNR})$$\n\nIf the link budget is critical, SNR is low, that means SNR ≪ 1. In that case, the logarithm in (1) is well approximated by a linear function. We have\n\n$$R \\approx \\frac{\\text{SNR}}{\\ln 2}$$\n\nIn that regime, you can hardly do anything better than concatenating standard methods of forward-error correction coding designed for moderate rates with repetition coding in order to get an overall very low rate.\n\nLet us consider repetition coding modulated with Gaussian minimum shift keying (GMSK) as used in GSM. Consider a repetition code of rate 1/T with two codewords, the all-one and the all-zero word. If we feed the all-zero codeword into the frequency modulator, the phase is repeatedly shifted upwards. This is equivalent to an increase of frequency. This effect is well-known and even utilized in GSM. Fig. 1 shows the short-term spectrum of GSM during the frequency correction burst which contains 148 consecutive 0-bits [5]. This temporary sine tone at the shifted frequency is used in GSM for initial frequency synchronization and coarse time slot synchronization.\n\nFor the all-one codeword, the short-term spectrum looks very similar. The frequency shift is not towards lower frequencies, but also upwards. This is as GSM uses differential precoding. Thus, a sequence of 148 1-bits is first converted into a sequence of at least 147 0-symbolsm before it is fed into the modulator. For a duration of at least 142 symbols¹, the instantaneous frequency is identical. However, the waveform is phase-shifted by π.\n\nThe repetition code composed of the all-zero and the all-one codeword shapes the spectrum of GMSK. The modified spectrum has a raised carrier frequency with reduced sidelobes. During phase changes the sidelobes are predominantly left of the raised carrier frequency. The spectrum is asymmetric.\n\nAn asymmetric spectrum is well-suited for a multi-carrier system. If the rightmost subcarrier had a spectrum as shown in Fig. 1, the strong sidelobes to the left would interfere with lower subcarriers. Only the weak sidelobes to the right would contribute to out-of-band radiation. While this is good news for the top subcarrier, it is very bad at the lowest subcarrier frequency. There, the strong sidelobes would be out-of-band.\n\nThe spectrum in Fig. 1 can be flipped. For that purpose, we need to change the repetition code from R_u = {0000 . . . ,1111 . . . } to R_l = {1010 . . . ,0101 . . .}. After differential precoding, this leads to an all-one sequence of at least 147 symbols. As MSK maps a logical 0 to a phase shift of ϕ = π/2 and a logical 1 to a phase shift of ϕ = −π/2, it results in a lowering of the instantaneous frequency.\n\nThe roadmap towards reduced out-of-band radiation should be clear now: We use the code R_u for all subcarriers in the upper sideband (right of the center of the band) and the code R_l for all subcarriers in the lower sideband (left of the center of the band).

Antenna/Subcarrier-Dependent Constellation\n    We can optimize the spectral shape without influencing the performance, e.g., error and information rate, of\n    a digital communication system. In discrete time, a phase shift by ϕ and by ϕ + 2π cannot be distinguished. In\n    continuous time, however, the output signals of a CPFSK modulator differ. For the latter case, the instantaneous\n    frequency is larger than for the former. This influences the spectral shape.\n       Consider the general set of PSK phase shifts\n\n                             P(ω) = 0, 2π − 2πω1, . . . , 2π(M − 1) − 2πωM−1 .                               (7)\n                                         M                  M\n    for some binary vector ω = [ω1, . . . , ωM−1] ∈ {0, 1}M−1. For each subcarrier, we can find the optimal vector\n    ω, such that the spectrum of the aggregated signal of all subcarriers is most confined.\n   For the leftmost subcarrier the optimal choice is the all-zero vector, if the number of subcarriers is large.\n    For the rightmost subcarrier, it is the all one-vector. This is, as we prefer the sidelobes to appear towards the\n    center of the channel band.\n    For other subcarriers, the optimization can be tedious and requires a clear way to measure spectral confine-\n    ment. This task is left open for future work. In this work, we opt for an heuristic, but reasonable approach: We\n    chose ω for each subcarrier in such a way that the maximal deviation of the instantaneous frequency from the\n    center of band is as small as possible. We call this method, as well as its generalizations with more sophisticated\n    optimization of the vector ω, multi-antenna towards inband shift keying.\n    B. Pulse Waveforms\n     In GSM, a Gaussian filtered rectangular frequency pulse shape is used. It is well optimized with respect to\n    the trade-off between spectral confinement and limiting intersymbol interference caused by lack of temporal\n    orthogonality. In MA-TISK, the particular choice of the frequency pulse shape is much less critical.\n      The repetition code ensures that the shape of the pulse hardly causes intersymbol interference. Due to the\n    repetition code, the transmit signal is similar to a direct-sequence spread-spectrum signal with a row of the\n    discrete Fourier transform matrix as spreading sequence. The frequency pulse shape corresponds to the chip\n    pulse in the spread-spectrum signal. Even chip pulses that are not shift-orthogonal hardly create intersymbol\n    interference. They may interfere with few subsequent chips. But they hardly span long enough in time to cause\n    relevant intersymbol interference. The same considerations apply to the frequency pulses in MA-TISK.\n        The design of frequency pulses can overwhelmingly focus on spectral confinement. As argued above, inter-\n    symbol interference is not a critical issue due to the repetition coding. For GMSK pulses, we can thus go for\n    lower time-bandwidth products than in GSM. It also makes sense to consider totally different pulses like the\n    squared sine wave pulse used in [10]. Optimization of the frequency pulse shape is left open for future work.\n    C. Subcarrier Separation\nIdeally, the subcarriers are spaced in such a way that they can be easily demodulated via fast Fourier transform\n    (FFT) [11] while keeping the inter-carrier interference at a minimum.\n       For N subcarriers, the rate R of the repetition code should be slightly smaller than 1 . If we repeat for\n                                                                                      N\n    T > N   times, the frequency pulse has time to decay such that the instantaneous frequency is constant for N\n    symbol periods. In that case, we can sample the received signal, window it for N symbol periods and perfectly",

For each subcarrier, we can find the optimal vector ω, such that the spectrum of the aggregated signal of all subcarriers is most confined.\n\nFor the leftmost subcarrier the optimal choice is the all-zero vector, if the number of subcarriers is large. For the rightmost subcarrier, it is the all one-vector. This is, as we prefer the sidelobes to appear towards the center of the channel band.\n\nFor other subcarriers, the optimization can be tedious and requires a clear way to measure spectral confinement. This task is left open for future work. In this work, we opt for an heuristic, but reasonable approach: We chose ω for each subcarrier in such a way that the maximal deviation of the instantaneous frequency from the center of band is as small as possible. We call this method, as well as its generalizations with more sophisticated optimization of the vector ω, multi-antenna towards inband shift keying.\n\n## B. Pulse Waveforms\n\nIn GSM, a Gaussian filtered rectangular frequency pulse shape is used. It is well optimized with respect to the trade-off between spectral confinement and limiting intersymbol interference caused by lack of temporal orthogonality. In MA-TISK, the particular choice of the frequency pulse shape is much less critical.\n\nThe repetition code ensures that the shape of the pulse hardly causes intersymbol interference. Due to the repetition code, the transmit signal is similar to a direct-sequence spread-spectrum signal with a row of the discrete Fourier transform matrix as spreading sequence. The frequency pulse shape corresponds to the chip pulse in the spread-spectrum signal. Even chip pulses that are not shift-orthogonal hardly create intersymbol interference. They may interfere with few subsequent chips. But they hardly span long enough in time to cause relevant intersymbol interference. The same considerations apply to the frequency pulses in MA-TISK.\n\nThe design of frequency pulses can overwhelmingly focus on spectral confinement. As argued above, intersymbol interference is not a critical issue due to the repetition coding. For GMSK pulses, we can thus go for lower time-bandwidth products than in GSM. It also makes sense to consider totally different pulses like the squared sine wave pulse used in [10]. Optimization of the frequency pulse shape is left open for future work.\n\n## C. Subcarrier Separation\n\nIdeally, the subcarriers are spaced in such a way that they can be easily demodulated via fast Fourier transform (FFT) [11] while keeping the inter-carrier interference at a minimum.\n\nFor N subcarriers, the rate R of the repetition code should be slightly smaller than 1/N. If we repeat for T > N times, the frequency pulse has time to decay such that the instantaneous frequency is constant for N symbol periods. In that case, we can sample the received signal, window it for N symbol periods and perfectly",

This results in significant inter-carrier interference. Though,\n                    in combination with strong forward error-correction coding, an SIR of 8 dB is more than sufficient for reliable\n                        communication with quaternary modulation. For increasing values of T , the window of the FFT begins to span\n                         only that range of the symbol periods where the instantaneous frequency is constant. Thus, the subcarriers\npreserve orthogonality.\n                            The temporal combining gain is 18.1 dB. Note that the temporal combining gain can slightly exceed 18 dB\nas T = 70 > N = 64. Setting T > N                       is spectrally wasteful. However, it reduces inter-carrier interference, cf.\nTable I. Note that linear single-carrier modulation is also spectrally wasteful due to the roll-off factor.\n                                                     V. CONCLUSIONS & PROMISES\n                        Transmit beamforming is a spatial repetition code and can be replaced by a temporal repetition code without\n                       reducing the data rate or the link budget. This is conveniently implemented via a multi-carrier system where\neach subcarrier is mapped onto one transmit antenna.\n                      A multi-carrier system with repetition coding can be implemented via differentially precoded continuous phase\n                    frequency shift keying while avoiding the spectral issues that come with frequency modulation in single-carrier\nsystems. MA-TISK, a promising method of such implementation, is proposed.\n                          MA-TISK utilizes particular sets of phase shifts that depend on the position of the subcarrier within the\n                      channel band. This tilts the spectrum of each subcarrier towards the center of the band and reduces sidelobes\ntowards adjacent channels.\n                                 Although MA-TISK is a non-linear modulation, it can be demodulated like a linear one thanks to its\n                       combination with repetition coding and differential precoding. Intersymbol interference due to the memory of\n                      the continuous phase modulation is negligible. Cost-efficient demodulation by means of fast Fourier transform\nis possible.\n                               The transition phase may introduce some minor overhead. However, the overheads of competing systems,\ne.g., roll-off factors or blank subcarriers, are avoided.\n                         Thanks to its constant envelope, MA-TISK can be efficiently implemented by voltage controlled oscillators.\nPower amplifiers need neither be linear nor broadband and can operate without back-off at high efficiency.\n                             MA-TISK does not require beam alignment. Radio links can be set up fast without serious overhead. This\n                      makes MA-TISK suitable for the implementation of internet of things (IoT)-applications in the millimeter-wave\nand terahertz bands.\n                             MA-TISK is the more sensitive to multipath propagation the fewer antennas are deployed. This makes MA-\nTISK the more competitive the higher the carrier frequency.\n                                                          ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n                             The author would like to thank Martin Vossiek, Christian Carlowitz, and Leonhard Hahn for helpful dis-\n                           cussions on millimeter wave circuitry.

CONCLUSIONS & PROMISES\n\nTransmit beamforming is a spatial repetition code and can be replaced by a temporal repetition code without reducing the data rate or the link budget. This is conveniently implemented via a multi-carrier system where each subcarrier is mapped onto one transmit antenna.\n\nA multi-carrier system with repetition coding can be implemented via differentially precoded continuous phase frequency shift keying while avoiding the spectral issues that come with frequency modulation in single-carrier systems. MA-TISK, a promising method of such implementation, is proposed.\n\nMA-TISK utilizes particular sets of phase shifts that depend on the position of the subcarrier within the channel band. This tilts the spectrum of each subcarrier towards the center of the band and reduces sidelobes towards adjacent channels.\n\nAlthough MA-TISK is a non-linear modulation, it can be demodulated like a linear one thanks to its combination with repetition coding and differential precoding. Intersymbol interference due to the memory of the continuous phase modulation is negligible. Cost-efficient demodulation by means of fast Fourier transform is possible.\n\nThe transition phase may introduce some minor overhead. However, the overheads of competing systems, e.g., roll-off factors or blank subcarriers, are avoided.\n\nThanks to its constant envelope, MA-TISK can be efficiently implemented by voltage controlled oscillators. Power amplifiers need neither be linear nor broadband and can operate without back-off at high efficiency.\n\nMA-TISK does not require beam alignment. Radio links can be set up fast without serious overhead. This makes MA-TISK suitable for the implementation of internet of things (IoT)-applications in the millimeter-wave and terahertz bands.\n\nMA-TISK is the more sensitive to multipath propagation the fewer antennas are deployed. This makes MA-TISK the more competitive the higher the carrier frequency.\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nThe author would like to thank Martin Vossiek, Christian Carlowitz, and Leonhard Hahn for helpful discussions on millimeter wave circuitry.
