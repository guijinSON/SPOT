ILF3, a known modulator of the innate immune response, is involved in cardiovascular diseases. This study aims to investigate the role of ILF3 in abdominal aortic aneurysm formation. Here, we use multi-omics analyzes, transgenic male mice, and multiplex immunohistochemistry to unravel the underlying involvement of ILF3 in abdominal aortic aneurysms. The results show that macrophage ILF3 deficiency attenuates abdominal aortic aneurysm progression, while elevated macrophage ILF3 exacerbates abdominal aortic aneurysm lesions. Mechanistically, we reveal that macrophagic ILF3 increases NF-κB activity by hastening the decay of p105 mRNA, leading to amplified inflammation in macrophages. Meanwhile, ILF3 represses the anti-inflammatory action by inhibiting the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway through facilitating the ILF3/eIF4A1 complex-mediated enhancement of Keap1 translational efficiency. Moreover, Bardoxolone Methyl treatment alleviates the severity of abdominal aortic aneurysm lesions in the context of elevated ILF3 expression. Together, our findings underscore the significance of macrophage ILF3 in abdominal aortic aneurysm development and suggest its potential as a promising therapeutic target for abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n\nAbdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a complex fatal vascular disease characterized by irreversible enlargement of the aortic diameter, accompanied by focal inflammation, turbulent proteolytic activities, and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation1–3.

ILF3, a known modulator of the innate immune response, is involved in cardiovascular diseases. This study aims to investigate the role of ILF3 in abdominal aortic aneurysm formation. Here, we use multi-omics analyzes, transgenic male mice, and multiplex immunohistochemistry to unravel the underlying involvement of ILF3 in abdominal aortic aneurysms. The results show that macrophage ILF3 deficiency attenuates abdominal aortic aneurysm progression, while elevated macrophage ILF3 exacerbates abdominal aortic aneurysm lesions. Mechanistically, we reveal that macrophagic ILF3 increases NF-κB activity by hastening the decay of p105 mRNA, leading to amplified inflammation in macrophages. Meanwhile, ILF3 represses the anti-inflammatory action by inhibiting the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway through facilitating the ILF3/eIF4A1 complex-mediated enhancement of Keap1 translational efficiency. Moreover, Bardoxolone Methyl treatment alleviates the severity of abdominal aortic aneurysm lesions in the context of elevated ILF3 expression. Together, our findings underscore the significance of macrophage ILF3 in abdominal aortic aneurysm development and suggest its potential as a promising therapeutic target for abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n\nAbdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a complex fatal vascular disease characterized by irreversible enlargement of the aortic diameter, accompanied by focal inflammation, turbulent proteolytic activities, and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation1–3. Inflammatory cell infiltration and intense inflammatory response play crucial roles in AAA initiation and progression1,4. Recently, there has been an emphasis on the role of immune regulation in maintaining the inflammatory balance during AAA progression5. Clinical investigations have found that aneurysm size in patients with AAA is dependent on the imbalance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses6. Moreover, serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) were significantly increased in AAA patients, in contrast to a notable reduction\n\n1The Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Function Research, Chinese Ministry of Education, Chinese National Health Commission and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Department of Cardiology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China. 2Department of Cardiology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, Shandong, China. 3Department of Cardiology, the Second Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China. 4Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. 5Department of Emergency and Chest Pain Center, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China. 6These authors contributed equally: Zhao-yang Wang, Jie Cheng, Ying Wang, Hai-tao Yuan, Shao-jie Bi. e-mail: zhangyun@sdu.edu.cn; jiangwenjian@ccmu.edu.cn; chen919085@sdu.edu.cn; zhangmingxiang@sdu.edu.cn\n\nNature Communications | (2024) 15:7249",

Similar findings have been observed in human AAA explant cultures and murine models⁵,⁷. Recent microarray-based gene expression studies have confirmed that AAA is a chronic inflammatory disease, with the actions of activated macrophage subsets playing a significant role⁷. Macrophage infiltration into the adventitia serves as a seminal event in the onset of AAA pathogenesis, which mediates inflammatory homeostasis by producing chemokines and cytokines that is critical to aneurysmal progression⁸,⁹. However, the specific molecular mechanism of macrophage infiltration and inflammation in aneurysm dilatation are not yet fully delineated. Besides, no explicit therapy targeting the immunoinflammatory response is currently available to impede excessive inflammatory response and remodeling of the abdominal aortic wall.\n\nInterleukin enhancer-binding factor 3 (ILF3) is an RNA-binding protein initially identified as a positive regulator of IL2 gene expression¹⁰. Subsequent reports have indicated that ILF3 is also involved in dendritic cell maturation, innate immune response, and carcinoma progression¹¹,¹². More broadly, there is evidence that ILF3 is associated with cardiovascular diseases, such as stroke and myocardial infarction¹³,¹⁴. It has been reported that ILF3 is involved in the enhanced vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis due to the overexpression of circACTA2 via reducing CDK4 mRNA stability¹⁵. Nevertheless, no studies have been conducted to explore the role of ILF3 in AAA.\n\nThe current study identified ILF3 as the target gene because of its high expression and specificity with macrophages in AAA lesions, as determined through bioinformatic analyzes and immunoassays. By employing conditional macrophage ILF3-deficient and overexpression mouse strains, we revealed the detrimental role of macrophage ILF3 in AAA development, with macrophage ILF3 being positively correlated to the intensity of focal vascular inflammatory response. Mechanistic studies further demonstrated that macrophage ILF3 acts as a dual modulator in the inflammatory cascade, where it both accelerates p105 mRNA instability to potentiate NF-κB-driven pro-inflammatory cascades and enhances Keap1 translational efficiency via the ILF3/eIF4A1 complex to dampen the Keap1-Nrf2-mediated anti-inflammatory responses. Furthermore, interventions targeting ILF3 gene expression, as well as pharmacological interventions using BM, were found to effectively mitigate the exacerbated progression of AAA caused by high ILF3 expression. These findings thus help elucidate the mechanisms of aortic aneurysm formation and provide a framework to guide the future development of treatments for patients with AAA by targeting ILF3.\n\n## Results\n\n### ILF3 is elevated in human and murine AAA tissues\n\nTo pinpoint the candidate genes potentially associated with AAA, we downloaded publicly available data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE57691 and GSE12591), and DEGs were acquired via GEO2R analysis. 715 genes displayed the same trend in human and mouse AAA samples compared with normal controls, among which 410 genes were downregulated and 305 were upregulated (Fig. 1A). Among the top differentially expressed genes shown in the heatmap, ILF3 expression was significantly elevated in patients with AAA (Fig. 1B, and Supplementary Fig. 1A) and Ang-II-induced AAA mice (Fig. 1C), indicating a vital role of ILF3 in AAA progression. Besides, western blot (Figs. 1D, E), quantitative PCR (Fig. 1F), and immunohistochemical staining results (Supplementary Fig. 1B) showed that the expression of ILF3 was augmented in human AAA (patients' information in Supplementary Table 1). Similar results were also seen in Ang-II-induced mouse AAA compared with the control group (Figs. 1G–I; and Supplementary Fig. 1C).\n\n### Macrophage ILF3 is augmented during AAA progression\n\nTo discern ILF3's spatial role in AAA lesions, we utilized Seurat for analyzing human single-cell RNA sequencing data (GSE166676) from the GEO database. Through UMAP and canonical markers, we classified cells into seven types (Supplementary Figs. 1D, E); the representative genes in each cell type are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1F. GO analysis showed that the immune response, particularly mononuclear cell activation and focal adhesion, were elevated in ILF3⁺ cells compared with ILF3⁻ clusters (Supplementary Fig. 1G). Furthermore, a substantial increase in ILF3-positive macrophages was observed in human AAA lesions (Figs. 1J, K; Supplementary Figs. 1H–K), underscoring the critical role of macrophage ILF3 in AAA progression. To further explore ILF3's function in macrophages within AAA, we established AAA models at different pathological stages using Ang II induction over varied timeframes. Flow cytometry demonstrated a progressive rise in ILF3-positive macrophages with prolonged Ang II exposure (Fig. 1L; Supplementary Fig. 2A). Additionally, increased ILF3 expression in both human and mouse AAA samples was verified, with clear macrophage colocalization noted in immunofluorescence assays (Figs. 1M, N). Notably, ILF3 protein levels in bone marrow-derived and peritoneal macrophages from wild-type C57BL/6 J mice showed a time and dose-dependent increase upon Ang II treatment (Supplementary Figs. 2B–E). Collectively, these findings compellingly suggest that the marked elevation of ILF3 in macrophages plays a crucial role in AAA development.\n\n### Macrophage ILF3 overexpression exacerbates AAA formation\n\nObserving elevated ILF3 levels in AAA, particularly in macrophages, we investigated macrophage ILF3 overexpression's impact on AAA using ILF3 conditional overexpression mice (ILF3ᶠˡᵒˣ/ᶠˡᵒˣLysMCre⁺; hereafter referred to as ILF3ᴹ⁻ᵀᵍ) and its littermates (ILF3ᶠˡᵒˣ/ᶠˡᵒˣLysMCre⁻; hereafter referred to as ILF3ᴹ⁻ᵂᵀ) in an ApoE⁻/⁻ background (Supplementary Figs. 3A–3D). Following a 4-week saline infusion, no aneurysms were observed in either group (Fig. 2A). However, under Ang II induction, both groups experienced a significant rise in systolic blood pressure with Ang II, with no differences between the ILF3ᴹ⁻ᵀᵍApoE⁻/⁻ and ILF3ᴹ⁻ᵂᵀApoE⁻/⁻ mice (Supplementary Table 2). Notably, ILF3ᴹ⁻ᵀᵍApoE⁻/⁻ mice displayed more pronounced aortic dilation compared with ILF3ᴹ⁻ᵂᵀApoE⁻/⁻ mice (Fig. 2A). The incidence of AAA formation (Fig. 2B) and the rupture rate of AAA (Fig. 2C) in ILF3ᴹ⁻ᵀᵍ ApoE⁻/⁻ mice was markedly higher than that of ILF3ᴹ⁻ᵂᵀ ApoE⁻/⁻ group through the 4-week Ang II exposure. Among those subjected to Ang II infusion, 68.75% (22/32) of ILF3ᴹ⁻ᵀᵍApoE⁻/⁻ mice died, apparently higher than the mortality rate of ILF3ᴹ⁻ᵂᵀ ApoE⁻/⁻ (37.50%, 12/32; Fig. 2D). Vascular ultrasound imaging and maximal external aortic diameter detection further corroborated these findings, revealing more pronounced dilation in the ILF3ᴹ⁻ᵀᵍ ApoE⁻/⁻ mice post-Ang II infusion (Fig. 2E; Supplementary Fig. 3E). Histological analysis indicated no elastin disruption under baseline conditions; however, ILF3 overexpression in macrophages significantly exacerbated elastin degradation in Ang II-induced AAA models (Figs. 2F, G).\n\nTo further validate the role of macrophage ILF3 in AAA, we evaluated the effects of macrophage ILF3 overexpression in CaCl₂-induced AAA model mice. Consistent with the results observed in Ang-II-induced AAA model mice, ILF3ᴹ⁻ᵀᵍ mice were more susceptible to abdominal aortic dilation with increased maximal abdominal aortic diameter in CaCl₂-induced AAA model (Figs. 2H, I). Moreover, HE and VVG staining showed that elastic lamellae of ILF3ᴹ⁻ᵀᵍ mice were disrupted and degraded to a greater extent than that of ILF3ᴹ⁻ᵂᵀ mice (Supplementary Figs. 3F, G). Collectively, these results underscore the pivotal role of macrophage-derived ILF3 in promoting AAA formation and progression in both CaCl₂- and Ang II-induced models.\n\n### Macrophage ILF3 deficiency attenuates AAA formation\n\nTo identify whether macrophage ILF3 deficiency is protective against AAA formation, we constructed macrophage-ILF3 knockout mice (ILF3ᶠˡᵒˣ/ᶠˡᵒˣLysMCre⁺; hereafter referred to as ILF3ᴹ⁻ᴷᴼ) in ApoE⁻/⁻ mice (Supplementary Figs. 4A, B). Upon four weeks of Ang II or saline infusion, ILF3ᴹ⁻ᴷᴼApoE⁻/⁻ mice exhibited reduced aortic dilation in",

Furthermore, a substantial increase in ILF3-positive macrophages was observed in human AAA lesions (Figs. 1J, K; Supplementary Figs. 1H–K), underscoring the critical role of macrophage ILF3 in AAA progression. To further explore ILF3's function in macrophages within AAA, we established AAA models at different pathological stages using Ang II induction over varied timeframes. Flow cytometry demonstrated a progressive rise in ILF3-positive macrophages with prolonged Ang II exposure (Fig. 1L; Supplementary Fig. 2A). Additionally, increased ILF3 expression in both human and mouse AAA samples was verified, with clear macrophage colocalization noted in immunofluorescence assays (Figs. 1M, N). Notably, ILF3 protein levels in bone marrow-derived and peritoneal macrophages from wild-type C57BL/6 J mice showed a time and dose-dependent increase upon Ang II treatment (Supplementary Figs. 2B–E).

Following a 4-week saline infusion, no aneurysms were observed in either group (Fig. 2A).

Importantly, blood pressure measurements remained consistent between the two genotypes, both pre- and post-Ang II infusion (Supplementary Table 3). Upon Ang II treatment, ILF3ᴹ⁻ᴷᴼApoE⁻/⁻ mice showed a decreased incidence of AAA (Fig. 3B) and a reduced rupture rate (Fig. 3C) compared to ILF3ᴹ⁻ᵂᵀApoE⁻/⁻ mice. And the mortality rate of ILF3ᴹ⁻ᵂᵀApoE⁻/⁻ mice post-Ang II infusion was 40.63% (13/32), evidently higher than the 15.79% (6/38) observed in ILF3ᴹ⁻ᴷᴼApoE⁻/⁻ (Fig. 3D). Moreover, after Ang II infusion, ILF3ᴹ⁻ᴷᴼApoE⁻/⁻ mice exhibited a discernible reduction in aortic dilation relative to ILF3ᴹ⁻ᵂᵀApoE⁻/⁻ mice (Supplementary Fig. 4C; Fig. 3E). Histological assessments using HE and VVG staining revealed that ILF3-deficient mice presented with moderate elastic degradation (Fig. 3F, G). Using CaCl₂-induced AAA model, we also found that ILF3ᴹ⁻ᴷᴼ mice were less susceptible to abdominal aortic dilation with mitigated elastic degradation (Figs. 3H, I; Supplementary Figs. 4D, E).",

Representative confocal images of ILF3 (green) colocalized with CD68 (marker of macrophage, red) in aorta tissues from ApoE−/− mice treated with Ang II for different intervals (Scale bar=25μm; n = 8 per group).\n\nData are represented as mean ± SD. Statistical analyses:\n- For comparisons between two groups: Student's t-test with two-tailed analysis (1B–1C, 1E–1F, 1H–1I)\n- For comparisons between more than two groups: one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc multiple comparisons test (1L)\n\nBoxplots: first and third quartiles define box bounds; minima = first quartile minus 1.5 times IQR; maxima = third quartile plus 1.5 times IQR. Outliers displayed as individual points (1E–1F, 1H–1I and 1L).",

Boxplots were created using the first and third quartiles to define the bounds of the box, with the median shown in a circle. The minima are defined as the first quartile minus 1.5 times the inter-quartile range (IQR), and the maxima are defined as the third quartile plus 1.5 times the IQR. Violin plots display the density distribution of the data points through smoothed histograms.\n\nestablished role in RNA metabolism, a fact substantiated by both our enrichment analysis and previous studies¹⁰, we next conducted RNA Immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-seq). The results revealed that 83.2% of ILF3-bound RNAs were involved in protein coding, highlighting ILF3's critical role in biological functions via RNA metabolism (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, RIP-seq showed ILF3 was able to bind to both p105 and Keap1 RNA (Figs. 6B, C; Supplementary Fig. 10C, D). RT-PCR analysis indicated that ILF3 deficiency increased p105 mRNA expression without affecting Keap1 RNA levels in peritoneal and bone marrow-derived macrophages (Fig. 6D; Supplementary Fig. 10E).",

Violin plots display the density distribution of the data points through smoothed histograms.\n\nestablished role in RNA metabolism, a fact substantiated by both our enrichment analysis and previous studies¹⁰, we next conducted RNA Immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-seq). The results revealed that 83.2% of ILF3-bound RNAs were involved in protein coding, highlighting ILF3's critical role in biological functions via RNA metabolism (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, RIP-seq showed ILF3 was able to bind to both p105 and Keap1 RNA (Figs. 6B, C; Supplementary Fig. 10C, D). RT-PCR analysis indicated that ILF3 deficiency increased p105 mRNA expression without affecting Keap1 RNA levels in peritoneal and bone marrow-derived macrophages (Fig. 6D; Supplementary Fig. 10E).",

To further explore ILF3's influence on Keap1 protein expression, we performed IP-MS and found no interaction between ILF3 and Keap1. However, eIF4A1 emerged as a potential mediator, given its role in initiating cap-dependent eukaryotic protein translation (Fig. 6F). Subsequent Co-IP confirmed the interaction between ILF3 and eIF4A1 (Fig. 6G, H). Moreover, we employed the catRAPID method to estimate the binding potential of eIF4A1 protein to Keap1 mRNA21. The catRAPID identified a direct interaction between eIF4A1 protein and Keap1 mRNA, with a Global Score of 1.00 (scaling from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no RNA-binding ability and 1 indicates strong affinity). And it revealed that the predominant binding site for eIF4A1 is located in the 5' UTR of Keap1\n\nNature Communications | (2024) 15:7249 8",

To further explore ILF3's influence on Keap1 protein expression, we performed IP-MS and found no interaction between ILF3 and Keap1. However, eIF4A1 emerged as a potential mediator, given its role in initiating cap-dependent eukaryotic protein translation (Fig. 6F). Subsequent Co-IP confirmed the interaction between ILF3 and eIF4A1 (Fig. 6G, H). Moreover, we employed the catRAPID method to estimate the binding potential of eIF4A1 protein to Keap1 mRNA21. The catRAPID identified a direct interaction between eIF4A1 protein and Keap1 mRNA, with a Global Score of 1.00 (scaling from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no RNA-binding ability and 1 indicates strong affinity). And it revealed that the predominant binding site for eIF4A1 is located in the 5' UTR of Keap1\n\nNature Communications | (2024) 15:7249 8",

Subsequent Co-IP confirmed the interaction between ILF3 and eIF4A1 (Fig. 6G, H). Moreover, we employed the catRAPID method to estimate the binding potential of eIF4A1 protein to Keap1 mRNA21. The catRAPID identified a direct interaction between eIF4A1 protein and Keap1 mRNA, with a Global Score of 1.00 (scaling from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no RNA-binding ability and 1 indicates strong affinity). And it revealed that the predominant binding site for eIF4A1 is located in the 5' UTR of Keap1\n\nNature Communications | (2024) 15:7249 8",

This upregulation of macrophage ILF3 appears to accelerate the formation of AAA, as corroborated by human and mouse AAA tissue data. Importantly, we found that the activation of macrophage ILF3 disrupts the inflammatory balance within localized AAA lesions. This disruption occurs through two primary mechanisms: enhancing the NF-κB pathway by destabilizing p105 mRNA and inhibiting the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway by increasing Keap1 translational efficiency via the ILF3/eIF4A1 complex. Moreover, our study highlights the therapeutic potential of BM in mitigating the adverse effects of AAA exacerbated by macrophage ILF3 activation.\n\nPrior studies have shown that ILF3 is involved in the progression of cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction26,27. Our previous work demonstrated that elevated ILF3 expression could promote arteriosclerotic calcification by acting on the promoter regions of BMP2 and STAT1²⁸. A recent study revealed that ILF3 participates in the process of circACTA2 reducing CDK4 mRNA stability and protein expression via competing for association with CDK4 mRNA, thus leading to Ang II-induced VSMC death¹⁵. However, the specific role of ILF3 in AAA development is still unclear. Here, using bioinformatic and immunological methods, we have identified markedly elevated levels of ILF3 in AAA tissues of humans and mice. Notably, this increase was closely associated with a heightened accumulation of vascular macrophages, denoting the potential role of macrophage ILF3 in AAA progression.\n\nThe adventitial remodeling and inflammation are the main pathological features of AAA9,29. Macrophages are key phenotypes of immune cells in the adventitial, where they secrete pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1 to initiate a positive feedback loop to extensive remodeling of the aortic wall and eventual aortic dissection30,31. Mellak et al. found that macrophage depletion inhibits the development of AAA using bone marrow transplantation in ApoE−/− mice³². However, the underlying molecular mechanisms that regulate macrophagic inflammatory homeostasis in situ are still to be comprehensively understood. Our study addresses this gap through a comprehensive approach involving bioinformatic and proteomic analyzes. We discovered a robust association between ILF3 and inflammatory responses, specifically implicating the NF-κB and Keap1-Nrf2 pathways. Our gene silencing experiments showed that inhibiting macrophage ILF3 led to a marked reduction in macrophage infiltration. The dampened inflammatory response was directly associated with a pronounced reduction in aortic remodeling and dissection in mouse models of AAA, thereby unequivocally establishing a causal link between ILF3 activity and AAA pathology. Furthermore, our in vitro and in vivo analyzes added another layer of understanding. We found that ILF3 deficiency mitigates the release of the chemokine MCP-1 and reduces the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α. Given that MCP-1 is a potent chemotactic factor for macrophage recruitment³³ and that IL-6 and TNF-α are critical players in vascular inflammation34,35, our findings have broad implications.

          "value": "The overarching findings of our study demonstrated that ILF3 is upregulated in aneurysmal macrophages. This upregulation of macrophage ILF3 appears to accelerate the formation of AAA, as corroborated by human and mouse AAA tissue data. Importantly, we found that the activation of macrophage ILF3 disrupts the inflammatory balance within localized AAA lesions. This disruption occurs through two primary mechanisms: enhancing the NF-κB pathway by destabilizing p105 mRNA and inhibiting the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway by increasing Keap1 translational efficiency via the ILF3/eIF4A1 complex. Moreover, our study highlights the therapeutic potential of BM in mitigating the adverse effects of AAA exacerbated by macrophage ILF3 activation.\n\nPrior studies have shown that ILF3 is involved in the progression of cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction26,27. Our previous work demonstrated that elevated ILF3 expression could promote arteriosclerotic calcification by acting on the promoter regions of BMP2 and STAT1²⁸. A recent study revealed that ILF3 participates in the process of circACTA2 reducing CDK4 mRNA stability and protein expression via competing for association with CDK4 mRNA, thus leading to Ang II-induced VSMC death¹⁵. However, the specific role of ILF3 in AAA development is still unclear. Here, using bioinformatic and immunological methods, we have identified markedly elevated levels of ILF3 in AAA tissues of humans and mice. Notably, this increase was closely associated with a heightened accumulation of vascular macrophages, denoting the potential role of macrophage ILF3 in AAA progression.\n\nThe adventitial remodeling and inflammation are the main pathological features of AAA9,29. Macrophages are key phenotypes of immune cells in the adventitial, where they secrete pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1 to initiate a positive feedback loop to extensive remodeling of the aortic wall and eventual aortic dissection30,31. Mellak et al. found that macrophage depletion inhibits the development of AAA using bone marrow transplantation in ApoE−/− mice³². However, the underlying molecular mechanisms that regulate macrophagic inflammatory homeostasis in situ are still to be comprehensively understood. Our study addresses this gap through a comprehensive approach involving bioinformatic and proteomic analyzes. We discovered a robust association between ILF3 and inflammatory responses, specifically implicating the NF-κB and Keap1-Nrf2 pathways. Our gene silencing experiments showed that inhibiting macrophage ILF3 led to a marked reduction in macrophage infiltration. The dampened inflammatory response was directly associated with a pronounced reduction in aortic remodeling and dissection in mouse models of AAA, thereby unequivocally establishing a causal link between ILF3 activity and AAA pathology. Furthermore, our in vitro and in vivo analyzes added another layer of understanding. We found that ILF3 deficiency mitigates the release of the chemokine MCP-1 and reduces the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α.

Previous studies have reported that p105 acts as an essential suppressor of inflammation, with p105 deficiency leading to spontaneous",

However, the specific mechanisms by which p50/p105 regulates inflammatory responses in AAA lesions remain unclear. In this study, macrophage ILF3 deficiency caused an evident increase in cytoplasmic p105 and p50, as well as nuclear p50. Co-IP assays revealed elevated levels of p50:p105 and p50:p50 dimers, along with a decrease in p65:p50 dimers in ILF3-deficient macrophages.\n\nILF3 can bind to p105 mRNA, enhancing its degradation. Macrophage ILF3 also enhances Keap1 protein expression, leading to decreased nuclear Nrf2. Mechanistically, RIP-seq, IP-MS and ribosome profile analysis unveiled that ILF3 augmented Keap1 translational efficiency by forming the ILF3/eIF4A1/Keap1 mRNA complex.\n\nThese results demonstrate the role of ILF3 in modulating inflammatory homeostasis and suggest that ILF3 can affect the translation efficiency of specific proteins via the formation of protein complexes.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Microarray data collection and analysis\n\nThe NCBI-GEO database was searched for microarray or RNA-sequencing data related to abdominal aortic aneurysm. Two studies, GSE57691 and GSE12591, were evaluated. Only normal aorta and abdominal aortic aneurysm samples were selected in each dataset. GEO2R was used to analyze the raw data of microarrays and identify DEGs between the control tissues and AAA. Fold Change > 1.2 and P < 0.05 were used as the cut-off standards to obtain DEGs.\n\n### Single cell RNA-seq data processing\n\nSequencing data were acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession no. GSE166676). The Seurat package (Version 3.2.0) in R software (Version 4.2.1) was used for cross-sample adjustment, processing, and quality control. After removing low-quality cells, gene expression matrices were normalized, and 2000 features with high cell-to-cell variation were identified. Dimensionality reduction, clustering, and cell type mapping were performed.\n\nEnrichment analysis for the functions of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was conducted using the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functions in the Cluster Profiler in R.

Under the AAA pathological environment, ILF3 was upregulated in aneurysmal macrophages. Macrophage ILF3 activation accelerates the degradation of p105 mRNA and increases nuclear p65 translocation, intensifying pro-inflammatory responses via activation of the NF-κB pathway. On the other hand, macrophage ILF3 may bind to Keap1 mRNA via the protein complex ILF3-eIF4A1 and amplifies Keap1 translation, which contributes to the suppression of anti-inflammatory responses via restraining Keap1-Nrf2 activity. That destroys inflammatory homeostasis in focal AAA lesions, resulting in the development of AAA. Pharmacological therapy with bardoxolone methyl (BM) ameliorates ILF3 overexpression-induced AAA development via crosstalk with the NF-κB and Keap1-Nrf2 pathways.\n\ntargeting vector used for this purpose was engineered to include a splice acceptor (SA), a loxP-flanked STOP cassette containing three polyadenylation signals, and the ILF3 cDNA, followed by an additional polyadenylation signal. This vector was introduced into C57BL/6J zygotes via microinjection, along with Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA targeting the first intron of the Gt(ROSA)26Sor locus (ROSA26). The procedure was conducted by Viewsolid Biotech Co, Ltd, Beijing, China.

ILF3ᶠˡᵒˣ/ᶠˡᵒˣ mice, possessing two loxP sites flanking exon 3 of the ILF3 gene (Viewsolid Biotech Co, Ltd; Beijing, China), were crossed with C57BL/6 LysMCre mice to generate macrophage-ILF3 knockout mice (ILF3ᶠˡᵒˣ/ᶠˡᵒˣLysMCre⁺; hereafter referred to as ILF3ᴹ⁻ᴷᴼ) and controls (ILF3ᶠˡᵒˣ/ᶠˡᵒˣLysMCre⁻). ApoE⁻/⁻ mice were purchased from Beijing Viewsolid Biotechnology (Beijing, China) and crossed with ILF3ᴹ⁻ᴷᴼ, ILF3ᴹ⁻ᵀᵍ, and their littermates to generate macrophage ILF3 genetic-engineering mice in ApoE⁻/⁻ background.

Four weeks later, the abdominal aorta was collected for further analysis. Mouse aortic diameter was measured after cleaning the perivascular tissue using the microscope eyepiece reticle micrometer ruler, as mentioned in previous studies⁴⁶.\n\nTo establish a CaCl₂-induced AAA mouse model, infrarenal abdominal aortas were isolated and wrapped with fertile cotton balls presoaked in 0.5 mol/L calcium chloride for 15 min under general anesthesia using isoflurane. After four weeks, the mice were sacrificed for sample collection.\n\nBM (CDDO-Me, Selleck, Shanghai, China) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and further diluted in PEG300 and PBS.

Mouse aortic diameter was measured after cleaning the perivascular tissue using the microscope eyepiece reticle micrometer ruler, as mentioned in previous studies⁴⁶.\n\nTo establish a CaCl₂-induced AAA mouse model, infrarenal abdominal aortas were isolated and wrapped with fertile cotton balls presoaked in 0.5 mol/L calcium chloride for 15 min under general anesthesia using isoflurane. After four weeks, the mice were sacrificed for sample collection.\n\nBM (CDDO-Me, Selleck, Shanghai, China) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and further diluted in PEG300 and PBS. Ang II-infused and CaCl₂-treated mice were intraperitoneally injected with BM (1.25 mg/kg/day) or saline on the day after Ang II or CaCl₂",

Mice were sacrificed four weeks after Ang-II or saline perfusion, and body weights were obtained.\n\n## Vascular ultrasound and quantification of AAA\n\nPulse wave velocity and aortic diameter were assessed using an ultrasound machine (Visualsonics, Vevo2100). Before positioning the collection probe, the mice anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane were placed on the heated 37 °C plastic pillow, scratched with water ultrasonic transmission gel and coated on the mouse abdomen. Basal temperature and heart rate were observed throughout the ultrasound imaging procedure. Vascular ultrasonography was conducted to measure the maximal luminal diameter, with assessments independently carried out by two observers blinded to the experimental groups. Measurements were taken both the day before Ang II infusion and on day 28 post-infusion, as previously described⁴⁸,⁴⁹. B-mode imaging was used to determine the diameter of the suprarenal aorta and quantify the incidence of aneurysms according to the definition of AAA, which is defined by an enlargement of the aortic diameter by ≥50% compared to its baseline⁵⁰,⁵¹. Furthermore, any dissection resulting in an intramural hematoma in the AAA mouse model should be considered, even if the dilation is just 110%⁵⁰.\n\n## Macrophage isolation culture\n\nPeritoneal macrophages were isolated through peritoneal lavage three days after the intraperitoneal injection of sterile suspension of 6% starch. Peritoneal macrophages were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and cultured in DMEM medium with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% bovine serum.\n\nBone marrow-derived macrophages were isolated from mouse femurs and tibiae, as described previously⁵². PBS was used to flush out the bone marrows of femurs and tibiae with a syringe with a 27 G needle. Cell suspension under 4 °C to 1500 rpm centrifuge for 5 min. Cells were then cultured with complete DMEM containing 30 ng/ml recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) (R&D, Minnesota, USA) for macrophage differentiation. After 7 days, bone marrow-derived macrophages were acquired and used for further study.\n\n## Immunoblot analysis\n\nProtein samples were electrophoresed on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk at room temperature for 1 h and then incubated with a specific diluted primary antibody overnight. After being washed 3 times with TBST, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h.

Nuclear extracts isolated from cultured peritoneal macrophages (5 × 10⁶/ml) using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extract Reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, USA). The NF-κB and Nrf2 binding assay to predicted sites was conducted using annealed biotin labeled oligonucleotide probes. The labeled oligonucleotide probe designed for NF-κB is 5′(Biotin)-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′, and the probe for Nrf2 is 5′(Biotin)-TGGGGAACCTGTGCTGAGTCACTGGAG-3′.\n\n## RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP)\n\nThe RIP assay involved using the Magna RIP RNA-Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation Kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) in strict accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Anti-ILF3 (19887-1-AP, Proteintech) and anti-IgG antibodies were used to immunoprecipitation RNAs. The final analysis was performed with qRT-PCR, showing fold enrichment of the target RNAs between the immunoprecipitated and input fractions.\n\n## Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)\n\nThe cell lysates of macrophages were collected and centrifuged, followed by incubation with anti-P50 (SC-8414, Santa), anti-eIF4A1 (ab185946, Abcam), and anti-ILF3 (19887-1-AP, Proteintech) antibodies at 4 °C overnight. A lysate immunoprecipitated with anti-IgG (ab172730, Abcam) antibody was used as a negative control. The immunocomplexes were then purified using 30 µl of protein G magnetic beads (Bimake, Houston, USA) for 2 hours at 4 °C, centrifuged, and washed with Pierce™ IP Lysis Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) four to five times. The immunoprecipitated protein was further analyzed by western blot with target antibodies.\n\n## Histological analysis\n\nAbdominal aortas were harvested, perfused with saline, and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by embedding in paraffin and serial sectioning. Paraffin-embedded sections (5µm thick) were prepared for hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining to observe general morphology and Verhoff-Van Gieson (VVG) staining to evaluate elastin degradation. Elastin degradation was graded using a quantification method by counting the number of breaks per vessel³.\n\n## Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining\n\nThe paraffin embedded arterial sections were dewaxed and stained with primary antibodies, followed by a biotin-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Dianova, Rodeo, CA).\n\nFor immunofluorescence staining, sections were stained overnight with specific antibodies at 4 °C and then added with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies. Nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Specific fluorescence imaging was obtained by laser-scanning confocal microscopy (LSM710, Carl Zeiss, Germany).\n\n## Immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS)\n\nIP-MS was conducted as previously described⁵³. Briefly, peritoneal macrophages were obtained from C57BL/6 mice and separated. IP was performed using an immunoprecipitation kit (Abcam, Cambridge,",

In brief, cells were collected, resuspended, and lysed in lysis buffer containing the protease inhibitor cocktail. The resulting cell lysates and anti-ILF3 antibody (19887-1-AP, Proteintech) were mixed overnight in a rotary mixer at 4 °C. Next, 40 µL protein A sepharose bead slurry was added into each tube and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by 2000 g centrifugation for 2 min. After washing three times with 1 mL 1× wash buffer, 40 µL 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer added to the beads and boiled for 5 min to elute the complex.\n\nWestern blot analysis was used for the validation of IP samples. The gels were then excised and subjected to MS. UPLC-MS/MS involved using nano ACQUITY UPLC Columns (Waters) with Orbitrap Elite Mass Spectrometers (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The resulting MS/MS data were handled with Proteome Discoverer 1.3 (high peptide confidence, peptide ion score > 20).\n\n## Flow cytometry\n\nTo identify subsets of inflammatory cells in murine models, single-cell suspensions were isolated from mouse aortas following established protocols⁵⁴. The enzymatically digested suspensions were filtered through a 70 µm sterile mesh and centrifuged at 300 g for 5 minutes at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 0.5% BSA. Cell viability and count were determined using trypan blue exclusion and an automated cell counter (Countess, Life Technologies). Anti-CD16/CD32 (101302, biolgend) was added and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature to minimize nonspecific binding. Subsequently, cells were stained with specific marker antibodies APC anti-mouse CD83(121509, biolgend), Percpcy5.5 anti-mouse CD45(103132, biolgend), FITC anti-mouse CD11b(101206, biolgend), PE anti-mouse F4/80(12-4801-82, ebioscience), Pacific Blue anti-mouse Ly-6G/Ly-6C(Gr-1)(108429, biolgend), PE anti-mouse CD19(115507, biolgend), APC anti-mouse NK1.1(108709, biolgend) and FITC anti-mouse CD3 (100203, biolgend). Data were further analyzed by NovoExpress® Software.\n\n## The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa)\n\nAfter modeling, blood samples were collected and stored at −80 °C until further analysis. Following the manufacturers' guidelines, plasma levels of IL-6 (Cat#88-7064, Invitrogen), IL-10 (Cat#88-7105, Invitrogen), TNF-α (Cat#88-7324, Invitrogen), and MCP-1 (Cat#BMS6005, Invitrogen) were quantified using Elisa kits.\n\n## Proteomics\n\nTotal cellular protein was extracted from isolated peritoneal macrophages derived from both ILF3ᴹ⁻ᴷᴼ mice (n = 3) and wild-type counterparts (n = 3) for analysis through 4D label-free quantification (4D-LFQ) proteomics, conducted by PTM Biolabs (Hangzhou, China). The analysis employed a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5% for both protein identification and peptide spectral matching (PSM), establishing a threshold for differential expression: proteins with fold changes exceeding 1.2 and adjusted P values below 0.05 were classified as differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Functional enrichment analysis of these DEPs was carried out using a two-tailed Fisher's exact test. Significance was attributed to Gene Ontology (GO) terms, KEGG pathways, and protein domains that achieved a p-value of less than 0.05.\n\n## Ribosome sequencing (Ribo-seq) and RNA Sequencing\n\nRibosome profiling was performed on isolated peritoneal macrophages from both ILF3ᴹ⁻ᴷᴼ (n = 6) and ILF3ᴹ⁻ᵂᵀ (n = 6) tissues by Gene Denovo (Guangzhou, China). In brief, cycloheximide (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA; 100 µg/ml) was added to the peritoneal macrophage medium for 2 min to block translational elongation. The supernatant was collected after trituration and centrifuged at 20000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. To prepare RFs, 10 µL of RNase I (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) and 6µL of DNase I (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) were added to 400µL of lysate, mixed and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Nuclease digestion was halted via adding 10µL of SUPERase, an RNase Inhibitor (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). Then 100μL of digested RFs was added to the prepared Size exclusion columns (Illustra MicroSpin S-400 HR Columns; GE Healthcare; catalog no. 27- 5140-01) and centrifuged (600 g, 2 min). Subsequently, 10μL of 10% (w/v) SDS was added up to the elution, and RFs (size > 17nt) were separated via RNA Clean and Concentrator-25 kit (Zymo Research; R1017). Further, rRNA and residual DNA probes were removed via RNase H (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) and DNase I (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). Lastly, the RFs were refined by magnet beads (Vazyme, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China).\n\nRibo-seq libraries were framed by the NEBNext® Multiple Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina® (catalog no. E7300S, E7300L). In brief, adapters were added up to RFs, succeeded by reverse transcription and PCR amplification. The PCR products (140-160 bp size) were enriched to construct cDNA library, sequenced using Illumina HiSeqᵀᴹ X10. Moreover, we used FASTP to filter the raw data and remove low-quality bases (over 50%) or N bases (over 10%). After trimming the adapter sequences, reads with length between 20–40 bp were kept for analysis. Raw reads were filtered and mapped to the mouse ribosome RNA database using bowtie2. The reads mapped to rRNAs, transfer RNAs (tRNA), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and miRNAs were eliminated. Processed RNA-seq reads were mapped to the rn6 genome using whole-genome alignment by STAR with a 2-pass setting. Ribo-seq data analysis was performed as previously described.[23] Differential translated genes between groups were defined as |log2(FoldChange)| > 0.3 and p-value < 0.05.\n\nFor RNA-seq, total RNA of peritoneal macrophages from both ILF3ᴹ⁻ᴷᴼ (n = 6) and ILF3ᴹ⁻ᵂᵀ (n = 6) tissues was isolated utilizing the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). Subsequently, strand-specific libraries were constructed employing the TruSeq® Stranded Total RNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Library quantification was conducted using a Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, USA) and validated by Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA) to confirm the insert size and calculate the mole concentration. Library clustering was performed on a cBot system at a concentration of 10 pM, followed by sequencing on the HiSeq X Ten platform (Illumina, USA) (Illumina, USA). The sequencing raw reads were preprocessed to remove rRNA sequences, sequencing adapters, short fragments, and other low-quality reads. We employed Tophat v2.0.9⁵⁵ for mapping the filtered reads to the mouse mm10 reference genome, allowing for a maximum of two mismatches. Following genomic mapping, Cufflinks v2.1.1⁵⁶ was utilized with a reference annotation to calculate FPKM values for known gene models. Differential expression of genes between the groups was ascertained using the DESeq R package, with stringent criteria set at FoldChange > 2 and p-value < 0.05. Translational efficiency was quantified by the ratio of translating mRNAs to total mRNAs, defined as: TE = (FPKM in Ribo-seq) / (FPKM in RNA-seq). Furthermore, to elucidate the functional similarity among identified genes, we employed the Friends analysis, a method executed using the GOSemSim package⁵⁷. The raw data from the ribosome sequencing and associated mRNA sequencing conducted in this study are publicly available, which have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and can be accessed through the GEO Series accession numbers GSE241911, GSE242024, GSE242088, and GSE242185.\n\n## mRNA stability analysis and qRT-PCR\n\nMacrophages were suspended in TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) after treatment with actinomycin D (Act-D, 10 mg/mL) for 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h. Total RNA was purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) based on the manufacturer's recommendations. The total RNA was reverse transcribed by using the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Perfect Real Time) (Takara,\n\nNature Communications | (2024) 15:7249                                                                            15",

In brief, cycloheximide (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA; 100 µg/ml) was added to the peritoneal macrophage medium for 2 min to block translational elongation. The supernatant was collected after trituration and centrifuged at 20000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. To prepare RFs, 10 µL of RNase I (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) and 6µL of DNase I (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) were added to 400µL of lysate, mixed and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Nuclease digestion was halted via adding 10µL of SUPERase, an RNase Inhibitor (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). Then 100μL of digested RFs was added to the prepared Size exclusion columns (Illustra MicroSpin S-400 HR Columns; GE Healthcare; catalog no. 27- 5140-01) and centrifuged (600 g, 2 min). Subsequently, 10μL of 10% (w/v) SDS was added up to the elution, and RFs (size > 17nt) were separated via RNA Clean and Concentrator-25 kit (Zymo Research; R1017). Further, rRNA and residual DNA probes were removed via RNase H (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) and DNase I (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). Lastly, the RFs were refined by magnet beads (Vazyme, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China).\n\nRibo-seq libraries were framed by the NEBNext® Multiple Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina® (catalog no. E7300S, E7300L). In brief, adapters were added up to RFs, succeeded by reverse transcription and PCR amplification. The PCR products (140-160 bp size) were enriched to construct cDNA library, sequenced using Illumina HiSeqᵀᴹ X10. Moreover, we used FASTP to filter the raw data and remove low-quality bases (over 50%) or N bases (over 10%). After trimming the adapter sequences, reads with length between 20–40 bp were kept for analysis. Raw reads were filtered and mapped to the mouse ribosome RNA database using bowtie2. The reads mapped to rRNAs, transfer RNAs (tRNA), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and miRNAs were eliminated. Processed RNA-seq reads were mapped to the rn6 genome using whole-genome alignment by STAR with a 2-pass setting. Ribo-seq data analysis was performed as previously described.[23] Differential translated genes between groups were defined as |log2(FoldChange)| > 0.3 and p-value < 0.05.\n\nFor RNA-seq, total RNA of peritoneal macrophages from both ILF3ᴹ⁻ᴷᴼ (n = 6) and ILF3ᴹ⁻ᵂᵀ (n = 6) tissues was isolated utilizing the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). Subsequently, strand-specific libraries were constructed employing the TruSeq® Stranded Total RNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Library quantification was conducted using a Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, USA) and validated by Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA) to confirm the insert size and calculate the mole concentration. Library clustering was performed on a cBot system at a concentration of 10 pM, followed by sequencing on the HiSeq X Ten platform (Illumina, USA) (Illumina, USA). The sequencing raw reads were preprocessed to remove rRNA sequences, sequencing adapters, short fragments, and other low-quality reads. We employed Tophat v2.0.9⁵⁵ for mapping the filtered reads to the mouse mm10 reference genome, allowing for a maximum of two mismatches. Following genomic mapping, Cufflinks v2.1.1⁵⁶ was utilized with a reference annotation to calculate FPKM values for known gene models. Differential expression of genes between the groups was ascertained using the DESeq R package, with stringent criteria set at FoldChange > 2 and p-value < 0.05. Translational efficiency was quantified by the ratio of translating mRNAs to total mRNAs, defined as: TE = (FPKM in Ribo-seq) / (FPKM in RNA-seq). Furthermore, to elucidate the functional similarity among identified genes, we employed the Friends analysis, a method executed using the GOSemSim package⁵⁷.
