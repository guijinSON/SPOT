In flowering plants, DNA methylation is only partially remodeled in the gametes and the zygote. However, the timing and functional significance of the remodeling during plant gametogenesis remain obscure.\n\n**Results:** Here we show that DNA methylation remodeling starts after male meiosis in rice, with non-CG methylation, particularly at CHG sites, being first enhanced in the microspore and subsequently decreased in sperm. Functional analysis of rice CHG methyltransferase genes CMT3a and CMT3b indicates that CMT3a functions as the major CHG methyltransferase in rice meiocyte, while CMT3b is responsible for the increase of CHG methylation in microspore. The function of the two histone demethylases JMJ706 and JMJ707 that remove H3K9me2 may contribute to the decreased CHG methylation in sperm. During male gametogenesis CMT3a mainly silences TE and TE-related genes while CMT3b is required for repression of genes encoding factors involved in transcriptional and translational activities. In addition, CMT3b functions to repress zygotic gene expression in egg and participates in establishing the zygotic epigenome upon fertilization.\n\n**Conclusion:** Collectively, the results indicate that DNA methylation is dynamically remodeled during male gametogenesis, distinguish the function of CMT3a and CMT3b in sex cells, and underpin the functional significance of DNA methylation remodeling during rice reproduction.\n\n**Keywords:** Rice male gametogenesis, Egg, Zygote, DNA methylation, CMT3, JMJ706, JMJ707\n\n### Background\n\nDNA cytosine methylation is a hallmark for repression of transposable elements (TE) and related sequences in complex genomes such as flowering plants and vertebrates.

However, the timing and functional significance of the remodeling during plant gametogenesis remain obscure.\n\n**Results:** Here we show that DNA methylation remodeling starts after male meiosis in rice, with non-CG methylation, particularly at CHG sites, being first enhanced in the microspore and subsequently decreased in sperm. Functional analysis of rice CHG methyltransferase genes CMT3a and CMT3b indicates that CMT3a functions as the major CHG methyltransferase in rice meiocyte, while CMT3b is responsible for the increase of CHG methylation in microspore. The function of the two histone demethylases JMJ706 and JMJ707 that remove H3K9me2 may contribute to the decreased CHG methylation in sperm. During male gametogenesis CMT3a mainly silences TE and TE-related genes while CMT3b is required for repression of genes encoding factors involved in transcriptional and translational activities. In addition, CMT3b functions to repress zygotic gene expression in egg and participates in establishing the zygotic epigenome upon fertilization.\n\n**Conclusion:** Collectively, the results indicate that DNA methylation is dynamically remodeled during male gametogenesis, distinguish the function of CMT3a and CMT3b in sex cells, and underpin the functional significance of DNA methylation remodeling during rice reproduction.\n\n**Keywords:** Rice male gametogenesis, Egg, Zygote, DNA methylation, CMT3, JMJ706, JMJ707",

Non-CG (i.e. CHG and CHH) meth -\n              ylation in heterochromatin is maintained by plant-specific Chromomethylases3 (CMT3,\n              at CHG sites) and CMT2 (at CHH and CHG sites), which bind to the histone methyla       -\n              tion mark H3K9me2, while CHH methylation in euchromatin regions is maintained by\n              Domains Rearranged Methyltransferase2 (DRM2) guided by related siRNA [1]. DRM2\n              also mediates de novo DNA methylation regardless of sequence contexts [1]. All three\n              methylation sites are found in TE and TE-like sequences and in about 10–20% of genes\n              depending on plant species. DNA methylation in positive regulatory sequences impairs\n              gene transcription and causes gene silencing, but enhances gene activity when occurring\n              in repressive DNA elements [2]. CG methylation is also common within the transcribed\n              regions of genes, where is associated with gene activity [3]. In rice, DNA methylation\n              displays some differences in methylation levels and genomic distribution compared with\n              Arabidopsis. For instance, rice mCHH is enriched at euchromatin regions and many\n              genes are found to be methylated at CHH sites, especially around TSS [4,  5]. There are\n              also quite a number of genes methylated at CHG sites which are related to allelic-spe  -\n              cific expression in rice hybrids [6].\n                Epigenetic marks are reprogrammed in the gametes and after fertilization. In mam     -\n              mals, there are two distinct phases of epigenetic reprogramming to prevent inheritance\n              of ancestral epigenetic signatures. The first phase consists of a genome-wide erasure\n              of DNA methylation in the primordial germ cells (PGCs), the gamete precursors, fol     -\n              lowed by the reestablishment of epigenetic signatures to enable gamete maturation\n              and function [7,  8]. Global DNA methylation is once again erased post-fertilization in\n              early embryos, followed by another round of global de novo methylation during embryo\n              development [9–11]. In contrast with mammals, DNA methylation is not globally erased\n              in gametes in ﬂowering plants [12–17]. Unlike mammalian germ lines that are defined\n              already at an early stage of embryogenesis, thus before meiosis, the plant male and\n              female sexual lineages initiate as diploid meiocytes from somatic cells, which give rise to\n              haploid microspores after meiosis. The male microspores subsequently undergo mito      -\n              sis, producing the vegetative and generative cells. The generative cell is further divided\n              to produce two sperm cells in the mature pollen grain, the male gametophyte.

However, it remains unclear whether\n              the remodeling process is initiated in male meiocytes before meiosis or at the subse   -\n              quent steps after meiosis and whether DNA methylation remodeling is required for male\n              gametogenesis.\n                In this work, we analyzed DNA methylation in rice male meiocyte, microspore and\n              sperm and studied the function of a set of chromatin regulators during the process.\n              The results indicate that DNA methylation remodeling starts after meiosis of the male\n              meiocytes and that non-CG methylation, particularly at CHG sequences, is dynamically\n              remodeled during rice male gametogenesis.

About 400 meiocytes, 300 unicel -\n              lular microspores and 100 sperm cells were collected for bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq)\n              analysis using a protocol developed for small numbers of cells (Additional file     1: Fig.\n              S1a, b) [23]. Data with two biological replicates were obtained (Additional file    1: Fig.\n              S1c, Additional file  2: Table S1). Violin plots of the BS-seq data revealed that the over -\n              all CG methylation (mCG) levels (especially in TE and TE-related genes, TEG) gradu         -\n              ally increased during male gametogenesis (Fig.  1a), whereas CHG methylation (mCHG)\n              levels were first increased in unicellular microspore (UM) but subsequently decreased\n              in sperm (S) to the lowest levels (Fig.   1a). Density plots confirmed the mCHG varia      -\n              tions between microspore (UM) and meiocyte (Me) and between sperm (S) and micro -\n              spores (UM) (Fig.  1b). A similar trend of CHH methylation (mCHH) variation was also\n              observed (Fig. 1b). Scanning of differentially methylated regions (DMRs, defined within\n              100-bp windows, see Methods) between microspore and meiocyte (UM-Me) detected\n              more hyper than hypo CG (876 hyper versus 646 hypo), CHG (10,720 hyper versus 3,764\n              hypo), and CHH (31,501 hyper versus 20,983 hypo) DMRs, indicating a clear gain of\n              non-CG methylation in microspore (Fig.  1c, d).

The\n              mCHG levels in sperm were the lowest when compared with those in egg and zygote\n              or somatic tissues of the same rice variety (Additional file  1: Fig. S2a, see below), which\n              could be also observed in other rice varieties (Additional file  1: Fig. S2b) [4,  16, 17, 24].\n              Analysis of sex cell methylomes obtained from the Nipponbare (NIP) variety indicated\n              that sperm mCHG and mCHH levels were lower than pollen vegetative cell levels, but\n              comparable to central cells of the female gametophyte (Additional file    1: Fig. S2b) [16,\n              24]. About 2/3 (5,221/7,775) of the increased mCHG (hyper DMRs) in microspore (rela-\n              tive to meiocyte) were erased in sperm, the other 1/3 (2,554/7,775) microspore hyper\n              DMRs remained hyper-methylated in sperm (Additional file  1: Fig. S3a, clusters A and\n              B). These two clusters of the microspore hyper DMRs were located mainly in genic and\n              intergenic regions (Additional file  1: Fig. S3b), and showed enrichment of euchroma   -\n              tin histone marks (H3K36me3, H3K9ac) (Additional file  1: Fig. S3d).

          "md": "To study DNA methylation dynamics during male gametogenesis in rice, we manually isolated male meiocytes, unicellular microspores and sperms of the Zhonghua11 (ZH11) variety as previously described [17, 20–22]. About 400 meiocytes, 300 unicellular microspores and 100 sperm cells were collected for bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) analysis using a protocol developed for small numbers of cells (Additional file 1: Fig. S1a, b) [23]. Data with two biological replicates were obtained (Additional file 1: Fig. S1c, Additional file 2: Table S1). Violin plots of the BS-seq data revealed that the overall CG methylation (mCG) levels (especially in TE and TE-related genes, TEG) gradually increased during male gametogenesis (Fig. 1a), whereas CHG methylation (mCHG) levels were first increased in unicellular microspore (UM) but subsequently decreased in sperm (S) to the lowest levels (Fig. 1a). Density plots confirmed the mCHG variations between microspore (UM) and meiocyte (Me) and between sperm (S) and microspores (UM) (Fig. 1b). A similar trend of CHH methylation (mCHH) variation was also observed (Fig. 1b). Scanning of differentially methylated regions (DMRs, defined within 100-bp windows, see Methods) between microspore and meiocyte (UM-Me) detected more hyper than hypo CG (876 hyper versus 646 hypo), CHG (10,720 hyper versus 3,764 hypo), and CHH (31,501 hyper versus 20,983 hypo) DMRs, indicating a clear gain of non-CG methylation in microspore (Fig. 1c, d). In sperm relative to microspore, there were more hypo- than hyper-DMRs at non-CG, especially CHG context (30,455 hypo- compared to 1,727 hyper-DMRs), confirming a clear decrease of mCHG in sperm. The mCHG levels in sperm were the lowest when compared with those in egg and zygote or somatic tissues of the same rice variety (Additional file 1: Fig. S2a, see below), which could be also observed in other rice varieties (Additional file 1: Fig. S2b) [4, 16, 17, 24].\n\nAnalysis of sex cell methylomes obtained from the Nipponbare (NIP) variety indicated that sperm mCHG and mCHH levels were lower than pollen vegetative cell levels, but comparable to central cells of the female gametophyte (Additional file 1: Fig. S2b) [16, 24]. About 2/3 (5,221/7,775) of the increased mCHG (hyper DMRs) in microspore (relative to meiocyte) were erased in sperm, the other 1/3 (2,554/7,775) microspore hyper DMRs remained hyper-methylated in sperm (Additional file 1: Fig. S3a, clusters A and B). These two clusters of the microspore hyper DMRs were located mainly in genic and intergenic regions (Additional file 1: Fig. S3b), and showed enrichment of euchromatin histone marks (H3K36me3, H3K9ac) (Additional file 1: Fig. S3d). By contrast, many sperm hypo DMRs (12,588) that showed no change between microspore and meiocyte (Additional file 1: Fig. S3a), which corresponded mainly to TE and TEG (Additional file 1: Fig. S3b), and were enriched for the heterochromatin mark H3K9me2 (Additional file 1: Fig. S3d). The data indicate that during male gametogenesis mCHG and mCHH at both euchromatin and heterochromatin loci are dynamically remodeled to the lowest levels in sperm.\n\nFrom cluster A of the microspore hyper DMRs, 315 genes were identified. These genes are enriched for translation, ribonucleoprotein complex, and cellular protein metabolic functions, implying that mCHG in protein translation and RNA-binding pathway genes was particularly dynamic during meiocyte to sperm development (Additional file 1: Fig. S3e, Additional file 4: Table S3). Several genes showed lower expression in microspore",

The cmt3a mutants produced\n                mainly defective pollens and were infertile (Fig.  2b). Cytology sections revealed that the\n                cmt3a pollen development was arrested likely at the bicellular microspore stage (Addi       -\n                tional file 1: Fig. S5b).\n                  By contrast, the cmt3b mutants showed no clear plant morphological phenotype. To\n                check the effects of cmt3 mutations on DNA methylation during male gametogenesis,\n                we performed BS-seq of meiocyte, unicellular microspore, and sperm isolated from two\n                independent CRISPR/Cas9-free lines of cmt3a and/or cmt3b at T3-4 generation (as well\n                as a tissue culture-regenerated wild type line) (Additional file  2: Table S1). Violin plots\n                of the data revealed that mCHG was almost absent from cmt3a meiocyte (Fig.  2c, Addi-\n                tional file  1: Fig. S6a), consistent with the CMT3a loss-of-function effects in somatic\n                tissues [25]. To a lesser extent, mCG was also reduced in cmt3a meiocyte. However,\n                cmt3a sperm mCHG (as well as mCHH) levels became higher than the mutant meiocyte\n                (Fig.  2c), suggesting that additional activities partially restored mCHG and/or ectopi     -\n                cally mediated mCHH in the mutant sperm. DRM2 and CMT2 being highly expressed\n                in rice sperm (Additional file 1: Fig. S7a), the residual mCHG level in cmt3a sperm could\n                be maintained by RdDM or CMT2. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that\n                the drm2/cmt2 mutations also reduced the mCHG levels of those loci in leaves (Addi          -\n                tional file 1: Fig. S7b).\n                  By contrast, the cmt3b mutation led to a clear loss of overall mCHG in microspore and\n                sperm but the mutation effect was less clear in meiocyte (Fig.  2c, Additional file  1: Fig.\n                S6a). The cmt3b mutation also resulted in some increases of mCHH in sperm. Density\n                plots confirmed the observations (Additional file 1: Fig. S6b). The increases of mCHH in\n                cmt3a/b sperm might be of indirect effects to compensate mCHG loss in the mutants.\n                Nearly all of the cmt3b hypo-CHG DMRs in meiocyte and sperm overlapped with those\n                of cmt3a (Fig. 2d, e), indicating that CMT3b functioned to maintain mCHG on a fraction\n                of the CMT3a targets.

The cmt3a mutants produced mainly defective pollens and were infertile (Fig. 2b). Cytology sections revealed that the cmt3a pollen development was arrested likely at the bicellular microspore stage (Additional file 1: Fig. S5b).\n\nBy contrast, the cmt3b mutants showed no clear plant morphological phenotype. To check the effects of cmt3 mutations on DNA methylation during male gametogenesis, we performed BS-seq of meiocyte, unicellular microspore, and sperm isolated from two independent CRISPR/Cas9-free lines of cmt3a and/or cmt3b at T3-4 generation (as well as a tissue culture-regenerated wild type line) (Additional file 2: Table S1). Violin plots of the data revealed that mCHG was almost absent from cmt3a meiocyte (Fig. 2c, Additional file 1: Fig. S6a), consistent with the CMT3a loss-of-function effects in somatic tissues [25]. To a lesser extent, mCG was also reduced in cmt3a meiocyte. However, cmt3a sperm mCHG (as well as mCHH) levels became higher than the mutant meiocyte (Fig. 2c), suggesting that additional activities partially restored mCHG and/or ectopically mediated mCHH in the mutant sperm. DRM2 and CMT2 being highly expressed in rice sperm (Additional file 1: Fig. S7a), the residual mCHG level in cmt3a sperm could be maintained by RdDM or CMT2. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the drm2/cmt2 mutations also reduced the mCHG levels of those loci in leaves (Additional file 1: Fig. S7b).\n\nBy contrast, the cmt3b mutation led to a clear loss of overall mCHG in microspore and sperm but the mutation effect was less clear in meiocyte (Fig. 2c, Additional file 1: Fig. S6a). The cmt3b mutation also resulted in some increases of mCHH in sperm. Density plots confirmed the observations (Additional file 1: Fig. S6b). The increases of mCHH in cmt3a/b sperm might be of indirect effects to compensate mCHG loss in the mutants. Nearly all of the cmt3b hypo-CHG DMRs in meiocyte and sperm overlapped with those of cmt3a (Fig. 2d, e), indicating that CMT3b functioned to maintain mCHG on a fraction of the CMT3a targets.

The analysis indicates that CMT3b is required for the increase of mCHG in\n              microspore.\n\n              Histone demethylases JMJ706 and JMJ707 reduce CHG methylation\n              As CMT3a is not or lowly expressed in sperm, mCHG diluted by mitosis may not be\n              maintained in sperm. Alternatively, active DNA demethylation may be involved, as\n              mutations of DNA demethylases locally remodeled DNA methylation in sperm [17].\n              Since mCHG is linked to H3K9me2 through a positive feedback loop [27,  28], we inves-\n              tigated whether H3K9me2 demethylases were also involved in the decease of mCHG\n              in sperm. JMJ706 was shown to function as a H3K9 demethylase in rice [29]. JMJ707\n              is closely related to JMJ706 [29], of which JMJ707 showed high expression in sperm\n              (Additional file  1: Fig. S8a). To test whether the genes were involved in mCHG during\n              male gametogenesis, we produced jmj706 and jmj707 double knockout (KO) plants and\n              obtained two independent lines (Additional file 1: Fig. S8b). The KO lines (j67) showed a\n              reduced pollen viability and seed setting rate (Additional file  1: Fig. S8c, d). We analyzed\n              the DNA methylome of male meiocyte and sperm of the mutant lines (Cas9-free at T3-4\n              generation) and found that the mutations had no drastic effect on the overall methyla  -\n              tion in the cells (Fig.  3a, Additional file  1: Fig. S9a). However, the methylation levels of\n              the hypo-DMRs in wild type meiocyte versus microspore were increased in j67 meiocyte\n              (Fig. 3b, c, d). Similarly, the methylations levels of the hypo- DMRs in wild type sperm\n              versus microspore were augmented in j67 sperm (Fig.  3b, c, d). The jmj706/7 mutations\n              clearly elevated mCHG levels of cluster B DMRs in meiocyte and cluster C in sperm\n              (Additional file 1: Fig. S3c). There was no overlap between cmt3b and jmj706/7-affected\n              DMRs (Additional file  1: Fig. S9b). The analysis indicated that JMJ706/707 play a role to\n              reduce mCHG at a set of genomic loci (mainly TE or TEG) in male meiocyte and sperm.\n\n              Effect of the cmt3a/b and jmj706/7 mutations on sexual lineage‑specific methylation\n              It is shown that Arabidopsis male sex cells show sexual-lineage-specific methylation\n              (SLM) or sexual-lineage-hypermethylation (SLH) [18]. Using the published methods\n              [18], we identified 555 SLH loci in rice meiocyte, microspore and sperm relative to\n              somatic cells (seedling) (Additional file  1: Fig. S10a). The cmt3b mutations reduced the\n              SLH levels in all three male sex cell types, especially in microspore (Additional file 1: Fig.\n              S10b, c). By contrast, the jmj706/7 had no clear effect on SLH in the sex cells (Additional\n              file 1: Fig. S10b). Further analysis could divide the 555 SLH into 340 canonical SLH and\n              215 SLM loci (Additional file  1: Fig. S11a) [18]. The canonical SLH loci corresponded\n              mainly to TEs, while the SLM loci were located mainly in genes (body and promoter\n              regions) (Additional file  1: Fig. S11b), suggesting that SLM mainly targets genic regions\n              during male gametophyte and sperm development. In total, 132 genes were targeted by\n              SLM, which are enriched for translational function (Additional file  1: Fig. S11c, Addi -\n              tional file  5: Table S4). The 132 genes appeared to be repressed in sperm compared to\n              meiocyte or microspore (Additional file  1: Fig. S11d, e). The cmt3b mutation reduced\n              SLM and increased expression of some of the genes in sperm (Additional file      1: Fig.",

There were in total 4,868 upregulated genes (>     two-fold, Q < 0.01), of\n               which 1,648 were hypomethylated at CHG sites in cmt3a egg (Additional file 1: Fig. S12b,\n               c).

The\n               analysis indicates that CMT3a-mediated mCHG is required mainly for TEGs repression\n               in egg, consistent with previous results showing that cmt3a mutation resulted in burst\n               of TE expression [26]. The  cmt3b mutation resulted in totally 3,022 upregulated genes\n               (> two-fold, Q < 0.01) in egg, of which few were TEGs and only 120 (including 26 TEG)\n               were identified as hypo-CHG methylated genes in the mutant egg (Additional file  1: Fig.\n               S12b, c), indicating that unlike cmt3a, the cmt3b mutation de-repressed mainly non-TE-\n               related genes, which was likely independent of a clear loss of mCHG. However, about\n               40% of the upregulated genes in cmt3b overlapped with those detected in cmt3a eggs\n               (Additional file  1: Fig. S12d), suggesting that both CMT3 genes are required for gene\n               (mainly non-TEGs) repression in egg. The cmt3b mutation resulted in upregulation of\n               2,179 and downregulation of 1,870 genes in zygote (Additional file  1: Fig. S12b). Similar\n               to that observed in cmt3b egg, relatively few upregulated genes were TEGs or showed\n               hypo mCHG in cmt3b zygote (Additional file 1: Fig. S12c).\n\n               CMT3b represses zygotic genes in egg cells\n               In wild type zygote we identified 1804 down- and 2628 upregulated (>\n                                                                                    two-fold, Q < 0.01)\n               genes relative to egg (Fig.  6a). Among the upregulated genes, 416 overlapped with pre -\n               viously identified genes expressed in rice zygotes (Fig.   6b) [31]. The 416 genes were\n               enriched for chromatin replication and cell division functions (Fig.  6c), consistent with\n               zygotic genome activation to promote zygote cell division in plants [32]. Within the 416\n               zygotic genes, 83 were upregulated in cmt3b egg. By contrast, although the cmt3a muta -\n               tion caused a larger number of upregulated genes in egg, only 39 were among the 416\n               zygotic genes (Fig. 6d). Among the 83 zygotic genes upregulated in cmt3b egg were those\n               encode histones, chromatin proteins (HMGs, SMC2, TOP2), DNA methyltransferases\n               (MET1 and CMT3a), transcription factors (E2F, HAP3, NAC), and cell division-related\n               proteins (Fig. 6e, f, g, Additional file 7: Table S6).

Unlike in Arabidop -\n               sis meiocyte that has higher mCG but lower mCHH than in somatic tissues [18], DNA\n               methylation levels in rice male meiocyte were similar to somatic tissues (Additional",

The 416 genes were enriched for chromatin replication and cell division functions (Fig. 6c), consistent with zygotic genome activation to promote zygote cell division in plants [32]. Within the 416 zygotic genes, 83 were upregulated in cmt3b egg. By contrast, although the cmt3a mutation caused a larger number of upregulated genes in egg, only 39 were among the 416 zygotic genes (Fig. 6d). Among the 83 zygotic genes upregulated in cmt3b egg were those encode histones, chromatin proteins (HMGs, SMC2, TOP2), DNA methyltransferases (MET1 and CMT3a), transcription factors (E2F, HAP3, NAC), and cell division-related proteins (Fig. 6e, f, g, Additional file 7: Table S6). The analysis suggested that CMT3b has a function to repress zygote gene expression program in egg.\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Non-CG methylation dynamics during rice male gametogenesis\n\nPrevious results showed that DNA methylation in plants is partially remodeled or reconfigured in male and female gametes [12–17, 19]. In this work, we provided evidence that non-CG (mainly CHG) methylations are dynamically remodeled during rice male gametogenesis with the highest levels observed in microspore and the lowest levels in sperm. It is known that during male germline development there is a cell cycle arrest [33], which could account for the reduced mCHG and mCHH in sperm. Unlike in Arabidopsis meiocyte that has higher mCG but lower mCHH than in somatic tissues [18], DNA methylation levels in rice male meiocyte were similar to somatic tissues (Additional",

As hyper-\n              methylated genes are enriched for ribonucleoprotein complex (such as mRNA-bind        -\n              ing) and translation proteins in microspore, the mCHG increase may be also related to\n              repression of genes involved in transcriptional and translational activities that are shut -\n              down during meiosis or male gametogenesis [26].\n                The decrease of mCHG in sperm may be required for sperm development and/or\n              reshaping the sperm chromatin that lacks the compact silent center (CSC) found in egg\n              and zygote chromatin 3D structures [21], and contains specific histone variants and\n              modification patterns [35–39]. Alternatively, the decreased mCHG might facilitate the\n              decondensation of the sperm chromatin upon fusion with the egg cell nucleus after ferti-\n              lization, allowing initiation of transcription from the paternal genome [40].\n                The remodeling of non-CG methylation in rice sperm seemed to differ from Arabi      -\n              dopsis sperm where mCHH is lost or largely reduced [12]. This may be due to a different\n              mCHH landscape in the rice genome, which is mainly scattered in genic regions [4,    5].\n              In fact, in rice sperm mCHH was found to be reduced in genic regions, but appeared\n              to be enhanced in TE-rich pericentromeric regions (Additional file  1: Fig. S16a, b). The\n              increased mCHH at pericentromeric region in sperm may be indirectly promoted by\n              DNA demethylation at TE and repetitive sequence in the pollen vegetative cell in rice\n              [16]. Alternatively, siRNAs produced by microspore may be inherited into sperm, in\n              which they target heterochromatin LTR retrotransposon silencing through the RdDM\n              pathway. In addition, the reduced genic mCHG and mCHH may also involve DNA dem-\n              ethylases that were shown to function in rice sperm [17].\n\n              Distinct functions of CMT3a /b in reproductive cells\n              CMT3a is the major CHG methyltransferase in rice. CMT3a expression was detected in\n              meiocyte, but barely in sperm (Fig.  2a), which may contribute to the low mCHG levels\n              in sperm cells. However, CMT3a-mediated mCHG appeared essential for post-meiotic\n              development, as the cmt3a mutation that eliminated mCHG in meiocyte stopped the\n              pollen development at bicellular microspore stage. The expression pattern and mutation\n              effects indicate that CMT3b plays an important role in increasing mCHG in the micro -\n              spore in addition to complementing CMT3a for mCHG maintenance in meiocyte and\n              sperm. However, the present data suggest that CMT3b preferentially targets protein-\n              coding genes for methylation and is required for repression of transcriptional and/or\n              translational genes during male gametogenesis.\n                The present work indicated CMT3a/b also have distinct functions in egg. CMT3a plays\n              the major role in silencing TEGs, whereas CMT3b is required for repression of zygote\n              gene expression program in egg. The repression of cell vision genes by CMT3b in egg is\n              consistent with previous results showing that rice and maize egg cells are almost devoid\n              of transcripts encoding histone proteins [31, 41]. The cmt3b effects on zygote mCHG\n              and gene expression indicate that CMT3b participates in zygotic genome reprograming\n              by reestablishing mCHG methylation and by regulating gene expression.

Briefly, ovaries of non-pollinated and pollinated florets (about 6.5 h after pollination) were manually collected in RNAase-free water under a dissection microscope. The collected ovules were transferred to a solution containing 0.53 M mannitol and 1% proteinases inhibitors to release eggs or zygotes. All isolated cells were stained by FDA (Fluoresceinc diacetate, Sangon, 596–09-8) and collected by a micromanipulator system (Eppendorf, TransferMan® 4r).\n\nRNA-seq and BS-seq library construction\n\nFor RNA-seq library construction, mRNA isolated from different types of cells were reverse transcribed and amplified by using a Single Cell Full Length mRNA Amplification Kit (Vazyme, Cat.# N712) according to manufacturer's instruction. cDNAs were sheared into 200–400 bp DNA fragments followed by purification using VAHTS DNA Clean Beads (Vazyme, Cat.# N411). The rest steps were performed using the TruePrep DNA Library Prep Kit V2 for Illumina (Vazyme, Cat.# TD502). About 3000 sperm cells and 400 meiocytes were used to construct the transcriptome libraries. Fifty cells of egg or unicellular zygote were used for each replicate of the transcriptome library construction. BS-seq libraries were constructed using reported protocol [23]. About 300–400 cells were pooled for each replicate for sperm, meicoyte and unicellular microspore bisulfite seq library construction and fifty cells of egg or unicellular zygote were used to construct bisulfite seq library.\n\nSemi-thin section\n\nProper florets were gathered and 50% FAA (50 ml absolute ethanol, 10 ml 37% formaldehyde solution, 5 ml glacial acetic acid, add double distilled water to 100 ml) was used to fix samples. Semi-thin embedding were performed using Herau Kulzer Technovit 7100 resin. Briefly, the materials were first transferred to a gradient alcohol solution (70% for 4 h at 4° C, 85% for 1 h at room temperature, 95% for 1 h at room temperature, 100% for 2 h at room temperature), then immersed separately in a pre-infiltration solution (equal parts of 96% or absolute ethanol and base liquid Technovit 7100) and an infiltration solution (1 g hardener I dissolved in 100 ml base liquid) for two hours. The treated materials were embedded in a 65° C film stand with polymerisation solution (1 ml hardener is added with the help of a pipette and stirred into 15 ml of preparation solution) and then sliced.\n\nRNA-seq data analysis\n\nFirst, raw RNA-seq data were cleaned using fastp software to remove connectors and filter low-quality reads [45].
