Both Os14-3-3f and Os14-3-3g were inducible with differential gene expression levels under different abiotic stress and developmental stages in sensitive and tolerant indica rice cultivars as confirmed both at transcript and protein level.\n\nPlant 14-3-3s has been well characterized to function in several signaling pathways, biotic as well as abiotic stress and nutrient metabolism. We attempted comprehensive analysis of 14-3-3 genes in different plant lineages such as green algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), moss (Physcomitrella patens) and lycophyte (Selaginella moellendorffii), dicot Arabidopsis thaliana and monocot Oryza sativa sub sp. japonica at the gene and protein level. Sequence alignment results revealed that 14-3-3 isoforms were evolutionarily conserved across all taxa with variable C-terminal end. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the majority of 14-3-3 isoforms in rice belong to the non-epsilon group that clustered separately from the dicot group. Segmental duplication event played a significant role in the expansion of both, Arabidopsis and rice, 14-3-3 isoforms as revealed by synteny studies. In silico gene expression using Massive Parallel Signature Sequencing and microarray analysis revealed that 14-3-3 isoforms have variable expression in different tissue types and under different abiotic stress regime in Arabidopsis and japonica rice. Both, semi-quantitative and qPCR results, confirmed that Os14-3-3f and Os14-3-3g were inducible under abiotic stress in lamina and roots of indica rice and relatively higher under salinity and cold stress in Nonabokra, under dehydration stress in N-22 and under exogenous ABA in IR-29 usually after 3–6 h of treatment. Both, 14-3-3f and 14-3-3g, were highly expressed in flag leaves, stems and panicles and mature roots. These results were further confirmed by immunoblot analysis of rice cultivars using Os14-3-3f antibody generated from recombinant Os14-3-3f protein. The results provide the first comprehensive report of Os14-3-3 gene expression in indica rice cultivars which differ in tolerance to abiotic stress that might be useful for further research.\n\n### Keywords\n14-3-3 gene · Abiotic stress · Gene expression · Indica rice · Microarray · MPSS · Phylogenetic tree · Sequence alignment · Synteny mapping\n\n### Abbreviations\nDAP   Days after pollination\nMPSS  Massive parallel signature sequences\nTPM   Transcript per million\n\n## Introduction\n\nPlants being sessile develop complex mechanism to adjust physiological response to environmental stress.

          "value": "14-3-3 isoforms were relatively less conserved at the C-terminal region across plant groups. Both Os14-3-3f and Os14-3-3g were inducible with differential gene expression levels under different abiotic stress and developmental stages in sensitive and tolerant indica rice cultivars as confirmed both at transcript and protein level.\n\nPlant 14-3-3s has been well characterized to function in several signaling pathways, biotic as well as abiotic stress and nutrient metabolism. We attempted comprehensive analysis of 14-3-3 genes in different plant lineages such as green algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), moss (Physcomitrella patens) and lycophyte (Selaginella moellendorffii), dicot Arabidopsis thaliana and monocot Oryza sativa sub sp. japonica at the gene and protein level. Sequence alignment results revealed that 14-3-3 isoforms were evolutionarily conserved across all taxa with variable C-terminal end. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the majority of 14-3-3 isoforms in rice belong to the non-epsilon group that clustered separately from the dicot group. Segmental duplication event played a significant role in the expansion of both, Arabidopsis and rice, 14-3-3 isoforms as revealed by synteny studies. In silico gene expression using Massive Parallel Signature Sequencing and microarray analysis revealed that 14-3-3 isoforms have variable expression in different tissue types and under different abiotic stress regime in Arabidopsis and japonica rice. Both, semi-quantitative and qPCR results, confirmed that Os14-3-3f and Os14-3-3g were inducible under abiotic stress in lamina and roots of indica rice and relatively higher under salinity and cold stress in Nonabokra, under dehydration stress in N-22 and under exogenous ABA in IR-29 usually after 3–6 h of treatment. Both, 14-3-3f and 14-3-3g, were highly expressed in flag leaves, stems and panicles and mature roots. These results were further confirmed by immunoblot analysis of rice cultivars using Os14-3-3f antibody generated from recombinant Os14-3-3f protein. The results provide the first comprehensive report of Os14-3-3 gene expression in indica rice cultivars which differ in tolerance to abiotic stress that might be useful for further research.",

Rice being a staple cereal crop has been a focus of diverse research in plant science aimed at crop improvement, both qualitatively and quantitatively. In general, rice shows differences in sensitivity towards excess salinity at various developmental stages during its life cycle. It is considered relatively tolerant to salinity and dehydration at the germination stage, the young seedling stage and early reproductive stages, i.e., panicle initiation and pollination are the most salinity-sensitive growth stages, directly affecting the crop yield (Zeng et al. 2001; Ganguly et al. 2012; Shankar et al. 2016). Several recent studies have revealed rice genes to be either differentially expressed at different growth stages and/or one or more genes differentially regulated in stress-sensitive as compared to stress-tolerant rice cultivars under stress conditions (Walia et al. 2005; Muthuramalingam et al. 2017). A large number of stress-tolerant rice cultivars/landraces have been identified based on their phenotypical and physiological responses under various abiotic stress conditions (Degenkolbe et al. 2009). Rice exhibits genetic diversity in their sensitivity to salt stress. The high yielding indica rice varieties such as IR-64, IR-72 and IR-29 are mostly salt susceptible, while the low-yielding varieties such as Pokkali and Nonabokra are salt tolerant. Similarly, varieties such as Nagina-22 (N22), Vandana and Sahabhagi are low-yielding cultivars, but highly tolerant to extreme water stress condition. Such contrasting physiological differences are considerably useful and could be utilized for analysis and manipulation (introgress or overexpress) of stress-inducible genes/pathways from tolerant cultivars to high-yielding sensitive cultivars with an aim to increase crop productivity under extreme conditions (Reddy et al. 2017).\n\nPlant 14-3-3 proteins have been widely reported to be involved in metabolism (carbon and nitrogen); however, several recent studies have shown their involvement in biotic and abiotic stress response (Denison et al. 2011). These studies have also indicated the dynamic expression of 14-3-3 proteins briefly regulated in response to diverse stress stimuli (Chen et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2016) and stress-activated kinases (Shin et al. 2007). Preliminary reports of 14-3-3 in rice identified four putatively expressed 14-3-3 isoforms among eight rice 14-3-3 genes which were differentially regulated by biotic as well as abiotic stimuli (Chen et al. 2006). Yao et al. (2007) reported that rice 14-3-3 genes were phylogenetically similar to Arabidopsis 14-3-3 isoforms with rice 14-3-3s exhibiting differential gene expression under different abiotic stresses and hormonal regime. To confirm these findings, further in-depth analysis of 14-3-3 isoforms among different plant taxa including Arabidopsis and rice based on gene structure and detection of shared synteny is necessary to understand the evolutionary aspects of 14-3-3 genes in monocots and dicots. As 14-3-3 interacts with diverse clients and is regulated by diverse stress stimuli and hormonal regime, a comprehensive gene expression study under various abiotic stress module utilizing stress-sensitive as well as -tolerant cultivars simultaneously will be beneficial to decipher its role in abiotic stress.\n\nIndica rice cultivars with contrasting (both sensitive and tolerant) tolerance to abiotic stress provide a suitable system to study the gene expression pattern of 14-3-3 for further research.

It is considered relatively tolerant to salinity and dehydration at the germination stage, the young seedling stage and early reproductive stages, i.e., panicle initiation and pollination are the most salinity-sensitive growth stages, directly affecting the crop yield (Zeng et al. 2001; Ganguly et al. 2012; Shankar et al. 2016). Several recent studies have revealed rice genes to be either differentially expressed at different growth stages and/or one or more genes differentially regulated in stress-sensitive as compared to stress-tolerant rice cultivars under stress conditions (Walia et al. 2005; Muthuramalingam et al. 2017). A large number of stress-tolerant rice cultivars/landraces have been identified based on their phenotypical and physiological responses under various abiotic stress conditions (Degenkolbe et al. 2009). Rice exhibits genetic diversity in their sensitivity to salt stress. The high yielding indica rice varieties such as IR-64, IR-72 and IR-29 are mostly salt susceptible, while the low-yielding varieties such as Pokkali and Nonabokra are salt tolerant. Similarly, varieties such as Nagina-22 (N22), Vandana and Sahabhagi are low-yielding cultivars, but highly tolerant to extreme water stress condition. Such contrasting physiological differences are considerably useful and could be utilized for analysis and manipulation (introgress or overexpress) of stress-inducible genes/pathways from tolerant cultivars to high-yielding sensitive cultivars with an aim to increase crop productivity under extreme conditions (Reddy et al. 2017).\n\nPlant 14-3-3 proteins have been widely reported to be involved in metabolism (carbon and nitrogen); however, several recent studies have shown their involvement in biotic and abiotic stress response (Denison et al. 2011). These studies have also indicated the dynamic expression of 14-3-3 proteins briefly regulated in response to diverse stress stimuli (Chen et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2016) and stress-activated kinases (Shin et al. 2007). Preliminary reports of 14-3-3 in rice identified four putatively expressed 14-3-3 isoforms among eight rice 14-3-3 genes which were differentially regulated by biotic as well as abiotic stimuli (Chen et al. 2006). Yao et al. (2007) reported that rice 14-3-3 genes were phylogenetically similar to Arabidopsis 14-3-3 isoforms with rice 14-3-3s exhibiting differential gene expression under different abiotic stresses and hormonal regime. To confirm these findings, further in-depth analysis of 14-3-3 isoforms among different plant taxa including Arabidopsis and rice based on gene structure and detection of shared synteny is necessary to understand the evolutionary aspects of 14-3-3 genes in monocots and dicots. As 14-3-3 interacts with diverse clients and is regulated by diverse stress stimuli and hormonal regime, a comprehensive gene expression study under various abiotic stress module utilizing stress-sensitive as well as -tolerant cultivars simultaneously will be beneficial to decipher its role in abiotic stress.\n\nIndica rice cultivars with contrasting (both sensitive and tolerant) tolerance to abiotic stress provide a suitable system to study the gene expression pattern of 14-3-3 for further research. Keeping in view the importance of 14-3-3 proteins, we made a genome-wide in silico characterization of the 14-3-3 gene isoforms in different plant lineages including Arabidopsis and rice and presented a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the 14-3-3 gene/isoforms with their gene and protein structure. We have attempted to gain knowledge on the overall gene expression pattern under different environmental stress using the open access Microarray and Massive Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) database-derived information emphasizing on the Arabidopsis and",
          "md": "controlled by signal transduction and metabolism regulation that have been known to occur via phosphorylation-mediated transition of protein states (Tian et al. 2015). 14-3-3 Proteins are a large family of small acidic proteins (~ 30kD), which are highly conserved even between kingdoms (Fu et al. 2000; Paul et al. 2009) and typically function as dimers. They are functionally characterized as phosphor-serine binding proteins (bind to phosphorylated motifs) and modulate cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell cycle, metabolism, membrane trafficking, stress responses and apoptosis in mammalian cells (Shin et al. 2011).\n\n14-3-3 Proteins in plants comprise multiple isoforms with differential subcellular localization (Bihn et al. 1997; Ferl et al. 2002; Chen et al. 2006). Unlike animals which have seven 14-3-3 proteins, the majority of plants possess multiple 14-3-3 isoforms suggesting that their isoforms specifically function and are involved in multiple protein–protein interactions including response to environmental stress (Roberts et al. 2002; Yan et al. 2004; Xu and Shi 2006), metabolism or nutrient stress (Xu and Shi 2006; Shin et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2012), biotic/pathogenic stress (Roberts et al. 2002), membrane transport processes (Shin et al. 2011), regulation of floral transition process, and brassinosteroid (BR) and phytohormone signaling in plants (Purwestri et al. 2009; Jaspert et al. 2011; Taoka et al. 2011; Roberts 2017). To date, several 14-3-3 isoforms have been reported in plants such as Arabidopsis (15 isoforms), rice (8 isoforms), Brachypodium distachyon (7 isoforms), barley (5 isoforms), tobacco (17 isoforms), cotton (6 isoforms), soybean (18 isoforms) and maize (26 isoforms), but only few have been phylogenetically and functionally characterized (Denison et al. 2011).\n\nAlthough the 14-3-3 proteins are found throughout the plant taxa, the majority of our knowledge on gene structure, organization and evolutionary history has been derived from studies in Arabidopsis owing to its large family of 14-3-3 isoforms (DeLille et al. 2001) and fully sequenced genome.

The 3D structure of rice 14-3-3 proteins were predicted using Phyre2 software at intensive mode (Kelley et al. 2015) and the structures were validated using Ramachandran plot analysis (Lovell et al. 2003).\n\nTo predict rice 14-3-3 targeted miRNAs, Os14-3-3 coding region was searched against published miRNAs in PMRD (Plant microRNA Database) (Zhang et al. 2010).\n\n### Expression analysis of 14-3-3 genes: exploring the microarray and MPSS database\n\nTo gain information on the putative role of different 14-3-3 isoforms in different growth stages and in lamina and root tissue under different stress response, we analyzed the publicly available microarray database of Arabidopsis and rice. Arabidopsis microarray data for the 14-3-3 genes in response to different abiotic stresses along with different developmental and reproductive stages were retrieved from AtGenExpress (http://jsp.weigelworld.org/expviz/expviz.jsp) for different abiotic stress conditions such as salt, drought, cold and various developmental stages (Schmid et al. 2005). Microarray data were obtained for different stresses at different time points, viz., 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h for both root and shoot tissues. Fold change at transcript level of different genes under stress was calculated",

For the developmental stage data, Affymetrix values were log10 transformed, heat maps generated and hierarchical clustering done using the MeV software package (Eisen et al. 1998). For microarray analysis of rice 14-3-3 genes, Affymetrix GeneChip rice genome arrays (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/; Gene Expression Omnibus platform accession nos. GSE6893) was used. The Affymetrix values were log2 transformed and heat maps generated using TIGR MeV software (Eisen et al. 1998).\n\nMicroarray dataset in rice is described as: roots of 7-day-old seedlings, mature leaf (collected before pollination, young leaf, 7-day-old seedlings, P(0–3 cm panicle), P2 (3–5 cm panicle), P3 (5–10 cm panicle), S1 (0–2 DAP), S2 (3–4 DAP), S3 (5–10 DAP), S4 (11–20 DAP), GC (growing callus), R1 (regenerating callus for 2 days), R2 (regenerating callus for 4 days), R3 (regenerating callus for 6 days) and R4 (regenerating callus for 8 days). MPSS database is an important tool to get information on expression profiles of genes across different tissues and treatment types (Brenner et al. 2000). The expression profiles were analyzed for the 14-3-3 genes in the Plant MPSS database (Nakano et al. 2006) for Arabidopsis (http://mpss.udel.edu/at/mpssindex.php) and rice (http://mpss.udel.edu/Rice/mpssindex.php) in various tissues, developmental stages and abiotic stress based on the 20-nucleotide signature sequences using the locus IDs given in the TIGR database. The signature was considered to be significant when it uniquely identified an individual gene and showed perfect match (100% identity over 100% length of the tag). The quantitative estimate of gene expression for a selected signature sequence in a given library was represented as normalized abundance and transcript per million (TPM). The TPM values obtained for different libraries for all 14-3-3 isoforms in rice and Arabidopsis were plotted and analyzed.\n\n## Expression studies of rice 14-3-3 gene at the mRNA level by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and qRT-PCR under abiotic stress and in different developmental stages\n\nAmong eight 14-3-3 isoforms in O. sativa, we selected two isoforms 14-3-3f (non-epsilon) and 14-3-3g (epsilon) for gene expression analysis in three different indica rice cultivars: salt sensitive but high-yielding IR29, salt tolerant but low-yielding Nonabokra and drought tolerant but low-yielding Nagina-22. Gene expression was studied under salinity (200 mM), dehydration (20% PEG 6000), cold (4 °C) and ABA (100 µM) treatment at 0, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h in 12-day-old seedlings, and also during different developmental stages such as dry seeds, 4-day-old germinating seedlings, 12-day-old seedlings and 90-day-old mature plant's panicles, flag leaf, stems and roots.\n\nFull length 14-3-3f and 14-3-3g gene (promoter + ORF) from indica rice varieties (IR29, Nonabokra and N-22) was amplified from genomic DNA sequence as well as from cDNA using gene-specific primers (Supplementary Table S1) designed according to BLAST results from TIGR database, cloned in TA cloning vector and sequenced using M13Forward–M13 reverse primers. The sequence was matched with published sequence of 14-3-3f and 14-3-3g. For upstream analysis, 1 kb upstream was amplified from genomic DNA of all three rice varieties, cloned and sequenced. The upstream sequence was analyzed and compared for probable cis-regulatory elements for abiotic stress using PlantCARE and PlantPAN database. All the primers were prepared according to the sequence of the japonica rice database and used for amplification in indica rice cultivars.\n\nFor gene expression analysis, total RNA was isolated from seeds, lamina, roots, flag leaf, stems and panicles using RNA express reagent (Himedia, Mumbai, India). RNA samples were treated with RNase-free DNase I (NEB) and concentration and purity were measured with a spectrophotometer (NANODROP 2000; Thermo Scientific). First-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out with 5 µg of total RNA using Sensiscript RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) and oligodT primers. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR reactions were carried out with 1 µl of RT mix from different samples using Os14-3-3f and Os14-3-3g gene-specific primers.\n\nFor qRT-PCR, the reaction mixture contained 2 µl of 1:10 diluted cDNA, 10 µl of 2× SYBR Green Master Mix (GenetBio, Nonsan, South Korea) and 200 nM of each gene-specific primer in a final reaction volume of 20 µl in a 96-well optical reaction plate (Applied Biosystems). Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast machine was used to perform the qRT-PCR experiment. The PCR cycle was the same for all genes, i.e., 10 min at 95 °C and cycle of 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C and 30 s at 72 °C. Curve analysis was done and graphs were prepared by normalizing the values with the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene expression values. Relative expression levels were determined using the 2^−ΔΔCt method.

Gene expression was studied under salinity (200 mM), dehydration (20% PEG 6000), cold (4 °C) and ABA (100 µM) treatment at 0, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h in 12-day-old seedlings, and also during different developmental stages such as dry seeds, 4-day-old germinating seedlings, 12-day-old seedlings and 90-day-old mature plant's panicles, flag leaf, stems and roots.\n\nFull length 14-3-3f and 14-3-3g gene (promoter + ORF) from indica rice varieties (IR29, Nonabokra and N-22) was amplified from genomic DNA sequence as well as from cDNA using gene-specific primers (Supplementary Table S1) designed according to BLAST results from TIGR database, cloned in TA cloning vector and sequenced using M13Forward–M13 reverse primers. The sequence was matched with published sequence of 14-3-3f and 14-3-3g. For upstream analysis, 1 kb upstream was amplified from genomic DNA of all three rice varieties, cloned and sequenced. The upstream sequence was analyzed and compared for probable cis-regulatory elements for abiotic stress using PlantCARE and PlantPAN database. All the primers were prepared according to the sequence of the japonica rice database and used for amplification in indica rice cultivars.\n\nFor gene expression analysis, total RNA was isolated from seeds, lamina, roots, flag leaf, stems and panicles using RNA express reagent (Himedia, Mumbai, India). RNA samples were treated with RNase-free DNase I (NEB) and concentration and purity were measured with a spectrophotometer (NANODROP 2000; Thermo Scientific). First-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out with 5 µg of total RNA using Sensiscript RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) and oligodT primers. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR reactions were carried out with 1 µl of RT mix from different samples using Os14-3-3f and Os14-3-3g gene-specific primers.\n\nFor qRT-PCR, the reaction mixture contained 2 µl of 1:10 diluted cDNA, 10 µl of 2× SYBR Green Master Mix (GenetBio, Nonsan, South Korea) and 200 nM of each gene-specific primer in a final reaction volume of 20 µl in a 96-well optical reaction plate (Applied Biosystems). Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast machine was used to perform the qRT-PCR experiment. The PCR cycle was the same for all genes, i.e., 10 min at 95 °C and cycle of 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C and 30 s at 72 °C. Curve analysis was done and graphs were prepared by normalizing the values with the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene expression values. Relative expression levels were determined using the 2^−ΔΔCt method. The expression ratio was represented relative to the control value observed for the gene and fold change was calculated by the formula 2^−ΔΔCt, where ΔΔCt = (Ct_gene − Ct_gapdh)_treatment − (Ct_gene − Ct_gapdh)_control.

The nucleotide sequence length, number of exons, number of introns, predicted amino acid length, cellular localization, chromosomal location and gene annotation and accession numbers of each of the 14-3-3 isoforms in all plant lineages are represented in Supplementary Table S2. From our studies, all lower and higher plant groups possess 14-3-3 isoforms in varying number. The highest number of 14-3-3 isoforms was found in A. thaliana (15) followed by P. patens (12), O. sativa (8), S. moellendorffii (6) and C. reinhardtii (2). From alignment results using all isoforms in all taxa, the 14-3-3 proteins were found to be highly variable at the C-terminal amino acid residues. Protein alignments of 15 Arabidopsis 14-3-3's across all taxa show the highest similarity within the core region.

The 14-3-3 proteins of all five plant species were grouped into two major groups (epsilon group and non-epsilon group (Fig. 2) based on their gene structure (Ferl 2004). The epsilon group has a gene structure of six to seven exons and four to six introns (Fig. 3) and comprises EPSILON, OMICRON, MU, IOTA and PI. The majority of the 14-3-3 isoforms from the lower plant groups including the green alga C. reinhardtii, the lycophyte S. moellendorffii and the moss P. patens were included in the non-epsilon group. The non-epsilon group of Arabidopsis has four exons and three introns and consists of KAPPA, LAMBDA, PSI, NU, UPSILON, OMEGA, PHI and CHI. This group is further divided into three sub-branches: the kappa group harbors KAPPA and LAMBDA; the psi group contains PSI, NU and UPSILON; the omega group is made up of OMEGA, PHI and CHI. While, in Arabidopsis, the epsilon group cluster included five isoforms, namely epsilon, mu, rho, omicron and pi, P. patens included six and S. moellendorffii included four isoforms (Supplementary Table S2). However in O. sativa, the majority of the 14-3-3 isoforms were included in the non-epsilon group, except Os14-3-3g and Os14-3-3h that clustered in the epsilon group.",

Total protein was also extracted from roots, flag leaf, stems and seeds for expression analysis of Os14-3-3f. Tissue samples were homogenized in liquid nitrogen using phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) along with 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM PMSF and the extract was centrifuged at 10,000g for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein was then precipitated with 80% ammonium sulfate and the resulting pellet was dissolved in phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and dialyzed against the same buffer. Protein samples were quantified using Bradford assay. Equal concentration (5 µg) of protein was taken from each sample and separated on 15% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-P, Amersham). Blots were incubated overnight with anti-14-3-3f primary antibody (1:20,000 at 4 °C) and with H3 antibody (as constitutive protein), followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution, 4 h at 4 °C) and incubation with nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (NBT/BCIP) substrate (Himedia) in alkaline phosphatase buffer.\n\nThe bands obtained from the H3 protein blot and 14-3-3f protein blots were scanned using Quantity One Software (Biorad) and then the graph was prepared after normalization of the values.\n\nResults\n\nCharacterization of 14-3-3 isoforms in major plant lineages\n\nWe compared the 14-3-3 genes among major plant groups with whole genome sequences available including green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, moss Physcomitrella patens, Selaginella moellendorffii, Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa sub sp. japonica. The nucleotide sequence length, number of exons, number of introns, predicted amino acid length, cellular localization, chromosomal location and gene annotation and accession numbers of each of the 14-3-3 isoforms in all plant lineages are represented in Supplementary Table S2. From our studies, all lower and higher plant groups possess 14-3-3 isoforms in varying number. The highest number of 14-3-3 isoforms was found in A. thaliana (15) followed by P. patens (12), O. sativa (8), S. moellendorffii (6) and C. reinhardtii (2). From alignment results using all isoforms in all taxa, the 14-3-3 proteins were found to be highly variable at the C-terminal amino acid residues. Protein alignments of 15 Arabidopsis 14-3-3's across all taxa show the highest similarity within the core region. The C-terminal end is the part of the 14-3-3s that differs most, both in sequence and length, and the length of Arabidopsis C termini varies from 8 to 31 amino acids, counting from the last conserved residue (Fig. 1).\n\nPhylogenetic and gene structure analysis\n\nTo gain information on the phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships, we constructed a phylogenetic tree by maximum-likelihood (ML) method aligning full length protein sequences of 14-3-3 from all selected taxa including rice. The 14-3-3 proteins of all five plant species were grouped into two major groups (epsilon group and non-epsilon group (Fig. 2) based on their gene structure (Ferl 2004). The epsilon group has a gene structure of six to seven exons and four to six introns (Fig. 3) and comprises EPSILON, OMICRON, MU, IOTA and PI. The majority of the 14-3-3 isoforms from the lower plant groups including the green alga C. reinhardtii, the lycophyte S. moellendorffii and the moss P. patens were included in the non-epsilon group. The non-epsilon group of Arabidopsis has four exons and three introns and consists of KAPPA, LAMBDA, PSI, NU, UPSILON, OMEGA, PHI and CHI. This group is further divided into three sub-branches: the kappa group harbors KAPPA and LAMBDA; the psi group contains PSI, NU and UPSILON; the omega group is made up of OMEGA, PHI and CHI. While, in Arabidopsis, the epsilon group cluster included five isoforms, namely epsilon, mu, rho, omicron and pi, P. patens included six and S. moellendorffii included four isoforms (Supplementary Table S2). However in O. sativa, the majority of the 14-3-3 isoforms were included in the non-epsilon group, except Os14-3-3g and Os14-3-3h that clustered in the epsilon group.",

All the 15 14-3-3 isoforms were distributed throughout the five chromosomes of A. thaliana and eight 14-3-3s in six chromosomes in O. sativa (Fig. 4). All 15 14-3-3 isoforms in Arabidopsis were located in the same syntenic block (Fig. 5), with 8 isoforms exhibiting duplication events in the same chromosomes (Chr1 and Chr5) and 7 isoforms showing segmental duplication events between different chromosomes. Isoform paired in Chr1, At14-3-3.2 and At14-3-3.13 as well as At14-3-3.11, At14-3-3.4 and At14-3-3.14 were located close in chromosomal position and also clustered together in the phylogenetic tree and paralogous to At14-3-3.1 at Chr4. However, in Oryza, the syntenic block (Fig. 5) with all eight isoforms showed segmental duplication events between different chromosomes, with the majority of duplications centered on Os14-3-3c at chromosome 8 that showed four duplicated pairs with Chr11, Chr1, Chr2 and Chr3, indicating that segmental duplication event played a significant role in the expansion of rice 14-3-3 isoforms. Both Arabidopsis and rice 14-3-3 isoforms were well studied and, to compare the origin and evolutionary relatedness between them, we did comparative synteny mapping between Arabidopsis and rice 14-3-3 orthologs. According to the synteny map, only two Arabidopsis 14-3-3 orthologs (At14-3-3.5 and At14-3-3.7) were found to have syntenic pairing (13%) with only three O. sativa 14-3-3 isoforms (14-3-3b, 14-3-3c, and 14-3-3e). These results were in congruence with earlier reports of 14-3-3 genes where segmental duplication events contributed predominantly to 14-3-3 gene expansion (Wu et al. 1997; Rosenquist et al. 2001; Cao et al. 2016).\n\n## Estimation of duplication event dates\n\nWe estimated the genetic divergence and gene duplication events assuming that synonymous silent substitutions per site occur at a constant rate over time. For this analysis, we calculated the Ks between the coding sequences of each paralogous pair of Os14-3-3 genes and used the mean Ks to estimate the approximate date of duplication event, with an estimated rate of silent-site substitutions of 6.5 × 10^-9 substitutions per synonymous site per year. Information about the mean Ks values for each duplication event and the estimated dates are shown in Table 1. Furthermore, the ratio of non-synonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitution rates among the duplicated genes was calculated. As standard, the Ka/Ks ratio equal to one indicates \"neutral mutation or no selection\" and less than one Ka/Ks indicates \"negative or purifying selection\", whereas Ka/Ks greater than one shows \"positive or Darwinian selection\". The Ka/Ks ratio was calculated to elucidate the evolutionary constraint and selection pressure acting on the 14-3-3 gene family in rice. The pairwise comparison results showed that all Ka/Ks ratios were smaller than 1, suggesting that the duplicated regions were subjected to purifying selection (Table 1).\n\n## Homology modeling of the 14-3-3 proteins in rice\n\nWe constructed 3D models of eight Os14-3-3 proteins of Oryza sativa subsp. japonica using protein homology/analogy recognition engine V 2.0, Phyre2 server (Kelley et al. 2015) with intensive mode modeling (Fig. 6). In modeling, the following templates were used to heuristically maximize the alignment coverage, percentage identity and confidence score for the submitted sequences: 2C1N:A and 2O02 templates for Os14-3-3h; 3E6Y:B, 2NPM:B and 1O9D:A templates for Os14-3-3a, Os14-3-3b, Os14-3-3-c, Os14-3-3g and Os14-3-3f; 2O8P, 2NPM:B, 3E6Y:B and 1O9D:A for Os14-3-3e and Os14-3-3d. The models were constructed with an accuracy of > 90% confidence (73–86% of residues) in Phyre2 as well as model quality was verified by Ramachandran plot analysis with > 90% confidence of residues in the allowed region, indicating the reliability of the predicted models for further analyses. Secondary structures in almost all the 14-3-3 isoform constituted α-helices (72–82%) and predicted disordered regions (14–20%) primarily spanning the C-terminal domain of 14-3-3 proteins.\n\n## Analysis of the 14-3-3 expression profile based on Massive Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) database\n\nWe have analyzed the expression profile of the 14-3-3 isoforms from Arabidopsis and rice MPSS database using 20 bp signature sequence from tissue-specific and abiotic stress-specific libraries (Fig. 7). Analysis of selected Arabidopsis tissue library revealed that a significant amount of gene expression (in terms of transcript abundance per million or TPM) was present only in ten isoforms from AtGRF1 to AtGRF10. Distinctly high expression levels in all tissue types except in germinating seedlings (GSE) were shown by AtGRF1, AtGRF3, AtGRF4, AtGRF9 and AtGRF11. Isoforms AtGRF3 and AtGRF6 showed a relatively higher expression in actively growing callus tissue (CAS). Isoforms AtGRF1 to AtGRF5 and AtGRF9 to AtGRF11 showed high expression in roots (ROS/ROF).

According to the synteny map, only two Arabidopsis 14-3-3 orthologs (At14-3-3.5 and At14-3-3.7) were found to have syntenic pairing (13%) with only three O. sativa 14-3-3 isoforms (14-3-3b, 14-3-3c, and 14-3-3e). These results were in congruence with earlier reports of 14-3-3 genes where segmental duplication events contributed predominantly to 14-3-3 gene expansion (Wu et al. 1997; Rosenquist et al. 2001; Cao et al. 2016).",

All the 15 14-3-3 isoforms were distributed throughout the five chromosomes of A. thaliana and eight 14-3-3s in six chromosomes in O. sativa (Fig. 4). All 15 14-3-3 isoforms in Arabidopsis were located in the same syntenic block (Fig. 5), with 8 isoforms exhibiting duplication events in the same chromosomes (Chr1 and Chr5) and 7 isoforms showing segmental duplication events between different chromosomes. Isoform paired in Chr1, At14-3-3.2 and At14-3-3.13 as well as At14-3-3.11, At14-3-3.4 and At14-3-3.14 were located close in chromosomal position and also clustered together in the phylogenetic tree and paralogous to At14-3-3.1 at Chr4.

For this analysis, we calculated the Ks between the coding sequences of each paralogous pair of Os14-3-3 genes and used the mean Ks to estimate the approximate date of duplication event, with an estimated rate of silent-site substitutions of 6.5 × 10^-9 substitutions per synonymous site per year. Information about the mean Ks values for each duplication event and the estimated dates are shown in Table 1. Furthermore, the ratio of non-synonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitution rates among the duplicated genes was calculated. As standard, the Ka/Ks ratio equal to one indicates \"neutral mutation or no selection\" and less than one Ka/Ks indicates \"negative or purifying selection\", whereas Ka/Ks greater than one shows \"positive or Darwinian selection\". The Ka/Ks ratio was calculated to elucidate the evolutionary constraint and selection pressure acting on the 14-3-3 gene family in rice. The pairwise comparison results showed that all Ka/Ks ratios were smaller than 1, suggesting that the duplicated regions were subjected to purifying selection (Table 1).",

Rice MPSS database revealed root-specific expressions of Os14-3-3a and Os14-3-3b isoforms as indicated by their consistent expression levels in young roots (NYR) and mature roots (NRA and NRB), and a significant increase in gene expression levels was observed under cold stress in young roots (NCR) in Os14-3-3b and under drought in Os14-3-3a. Similarly isoform Os14-3-3f was found to be relatively highly expressed in both young and mature leaves and germinating seedlings. Noticeably, although Os14-3-3b and Os14-3-3d showed relatively low basal-level expression, enhanced expression was noted in young leaf tissue after salt (NSL) and cold (NCL) treatments.\n\nContrastingly, while almost no expression was recorded for shoots, isoforms At14-3-3.1, At14-3-3.3, At14-3-3.5, At14-3-3.7 and At14-3-3.10 showed elevated gene expression levels in roots under drought treatment. Both At14-3-3.5 and At14-3-3.7 isoforms also showed high gene expression in root tissue under osmotic and heat stress (F). Unlike in shoots, At14-3-3.9 was only found to increase under oxidative stress in Arabidopsis roots. In roots the isoform At14-3-3.10 was found to be highly induced by dehydration, cold, heat, oxidative stress, genotoxicity, wounding and UV/B exposure. However, under salinity stress, the expression of At14-3-3.10 was increased within 1 h and declined until 12 h after which it showed moderate increase in expression levels. Almost no gene expression was detected in roots under different stress regimes for isoforms At14-3-3.11, At14-3-3.12, At14-3-3.13 and At14-3-3.\n\nMicroarray-based expression analysis of the 14-3-3 isoforms in Arabidopsis and rice\n\nMicroarray results also revealed variable expression profile of different isoforms for different tissue types. High gene expression in At14-3-3.12 to At14-3-3.15 was noted in shoots in response to salt, drought, cold and osmotic stress (Fig. 8). High expression of At14-3-3.9 was recorded in Arabidopsis shoots for almost all the stress treatments tested.\n\nWe performed expression analysis of 14-3-3 isoforms during the vegetative and reproductive stages using microarray data in Arabidopsis (Fig. 9). Microarray data information was found to be more detailed and rich compared to that in the MPSS database.

Moreover based on microarray and MPSS results, these two isoforms were found to differ widely in their expression pattern. Transcription factors (TF) affect gene expression by binding to the corresponding TF-binding sites (TFBS) in the upstream of the target gene.

These upstream elements play crucial roles in physiological processes like response to light, hormonal regulation and environmental effects. Promoter analysis revealed the presence of low-temperature responsive element (LTRE), both in Os14-3-3f and Os14-3-3g. Phytohormone-responsive elements like ARE (auxin responsive element) and ABRE (abscisic acid-responsive element) were also present, indicating a 14-3-3 role in phytohormone regulation.

In addition, binding sites of MYB transcription factor were found in Nonabokra and N-22 for both Os14-3-3f and Os14-3-3g and indicated its potential role in drought stress.\n\nThe evolutionary divergence of the 1 kb upstream and the coding sequence between different 14-3-3s of Arabidopsis and",

The scale for the relative expression value is given below the heat map, in which green color shows downregulation, dark green shows no significant change in expression and red color shows upregulation\n\n### Dehydration stress\n\nExpression of 14-3-3f in shoots and roots in IR29 increased steeply from 0 to 3 h (twofold) and recorded the highest at 6 h in lamina and 12 h in root tissue when exposed to 20% PEG6000 (Fig. 12b).

The expression of 14-3-3f was relatively higher in lamina than roots in all three cultivars. Relatively higher expression levels of 14-3-3f in Nonabokra roots was noted at 6 and 24 h (twofold) of treatment with a sharp decrease at 12 h. The expression of 14-3-3g in roots after cold treatment increased marginally from control and remained steady till 24 h of treatment. However, we noted that the expression of 14-3-3g was very high in control roots in Nonabokra and N-22 and the expression decreased steadily after 24 h of cold treatment (Fig. 12c).\n\n### Exogenous ABA treatment\n\nNo apparent increase in the expression of 14-3-3f in the lamina of N-22 and Nonabokra was noted (Fig. 12d). However in IR29, 14-3-3f increased strongly after 3 and 6 h (four fold) of treatment in lamina and decreased sharply after 12–24 h of ABA treatment.

The developmental stages used for analysis are depicted at the top of each column. The various stages used for expression profiling studies are roots of 7-day-old seedlings, mature leaf (collected before pollination), young leaf, 7-day-old seedlings, P(0–3 cm panicle), P2 (3–5 cm panicle), P3 (5–10 cm panicle), S1 (0–2 DAP), S2 (3–4 DAP), S3 (5–10 DAP), S4 (11–20 DAP), GC (growing callus), R1 (regenerating callus 2 days), R2 (regenerating callus 4 days), R3 (regenerating callus 6 days) and R4 (regenerating callus 8 days). The values are normalized and log₁₀ transformed. The scale for the relative expression value is shown at the bottom of the heat map in which green color denotes no significant change, while red color denotes the highest change in expression\n\nof ABA exposure. Moderate increase in 14-3-3g expression was recorded in roots of IR29, and N-22 after ABA treatment. However, the expression of 14-3-3g in Nonabokra roots was relatively higher in the control set and thereafter decreased on increasing the ABA exposure time interval. Both Nonabokra and N-22 showed a marginal increase in the 14-3-3g expression in roots on increasing the ABA exposure time interval. Nonabokra exhibited the highest expression of 14-3-3g transcript in the lamina at 12 h of treatment (Fig. 12d).\n\nto moderate expression was noted in Nonabokra across all stages of plant development (Fig. 12e).\n\n## Expression profiling of 14-3-3f and 14-3-3g using quantitative real-time PCR under various abiotic stress and developmental stages\n\n## Developmental stages of plant growth\n\n14-3-3f was found to express in all tested tissue and stage type in all rice cultivars. Moderate expression of 14-3-3f was noted in 12-day-old shoots, 12-day-old roots, stems, panicles and mature roots of IR29 (Fig. 12e). The expression of 14-3-3f in Nonabokra was only relatively high in flag leaf, stems and panicles. A fairly high expression of 14-3-3f was noted in stems, panicles and mature roots in N-22. A high expression of 14-3-3g was recorded in N-22 across all stages. Relatively high 14-3-3g expression in developing seed was found in N-22 compared to IR29 and Nonabokra. The expression of 14-3-3g in the flag leaf was the highest in N-22. A high expression of 14-3-3g was recorded in mature stems, panicles and mature roots of N-22. A very weak expression level of 14-3-3g was detected in IR29.

The relative transcript abundance of the Os14-3-3f and Os14-3-3g genes under various abiotic stresses, viz., salinity, dehydration, cold and exogenous ABA and in different stages of growth has been presented as bar graphs (Fig. 13). Our real-time PCR results were found to be consistent with semi-quantitative-PCR results. the expression of 14-3-3f as well as 14-3-3g increased significantly after 3 and 6 h of stress treatment.

However, a very low expression level of 14-3-3 was detected in Nonabokra roots under cold stress. Moreover, 14-3-3g was upregulated in roots of IR29 and N-22 in cold stress. The expression of 14-3-3g increased after ABA treatment in lamina and root samples of all three rice cultivars up to 6 h of treatment. Relatively higher transcript abundance was noted in roots of IR29 after ABA treatment. A major pathway activated by stresses such as drought, temperature and salt stress is the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway. High induction of Os14-3-3f and Os14-3-3g under ABA treatment supported their involvement in the ABA signal pathway by interaction with the AREB/ABF/ABI5-like transcription factors that bind to ABA-response elements (Schoonheim et al. 2007).\n\nOur qRT-PCR demonstrated a differential expression of Os14-3-3f and Os14-3-3g across different tissues. High 14-3-3f transcript levels were found in panicles, flag leaf and dry seeds and mature roots particularly in N-22 cultivars. Relatively high 14-3-3f transcript abundance was recorded in 4-day-old lamina in IR29 compared to Nonabokra and N-22. Our results showed low 14-3-3f expression levels in 4-day-old and 12-day-old lamina and roots. The expression of 14-3-3g was also very high in panicles, dry seeds, 4-day-old lamina and 12-day-old roots in N-22 cultivars. Unlike Os14-3-3f, high 14-3-3g transcripts accumulated in stems and 4-day-old roots, especially in Nonabokra and IR29 (Fig. 13).\n\n## Inducible expression of Os14-3-3f protein in response to abiotic stress\n\nWestern-blot analysis detected a single protein band differentially expressed at 28 kDa in different tissue types in three rice cultivars under different abiotic stress with respect to anti-histone H3 antibody (Fig. 14a). Densitometry scanning and normalization of Os14-3-3f bands (28 kDa) revealed a significant fold increase in protein expression after 3 and 6 h and declining thereafter at 12 and 24 h of exposure to salinity, dehydration and ABA, except in cold when Os14-3-3f protein was expressed even after 24 h of cold stress in Nonabokra (Fig. 14b). Compared to IR29, Nonabokra and N-22 showed a nearly twofold increase in protein expression level after 3 h of exposure to stress. In addition, Os14-3-3f was relatively highly expressed under dehydration condition in N-22. Similarly in both Nonabokra and N-22, a relatively high Os14-3-3f protein expression in seeds, flag leaf, stems, panicles and mature roots was determined compared to that in IR-29. Os14-3-3f protein accumulation was highest in flag leaves, stems and panicles and lowest in seeds and mature roots. These results were in congruence with our gene expression data and further confirmed that Os14-3-3f was highly inducible by one or more abiotic stress conditions.\n\noccurred under salinity and dehydration stress in N-22 and Nonabokra cultivars compared to sensitive IR29, confirming its important role in salt and drought stress regulation in rice. A high transcript abundance was detected for 14-3-3f in 6 h salt-treated roots. Similarly, N-22 cultivars showed a high 14-3-3f expression after 6 h of dehydration stress in lamina and roots. An increase in transcript level was also recorded under 6 h cold stress treatment, particularly in N-22 shoots and N-22 and Nonabokra roots. Unlike other treatments, 14-3-3f was found to be upregulated in both lamina and roots of IR29 after 6 h of ABA treatment. Our data therefore confirmed that Os14-3-3f was found to be highly inducible by salt and dehydration stress, especially both in shoots and in roots of Nonabokra and N-22, respectively, and might have an important role in the mitigation of abiotic stress.\n\nSimilar to Os14-3-3f, the expression of Os14-3-3g also moderately increased up to 6 h and then declined. Relatively high expression of Os14-3-3g was detected in roots of N-22 and Nonabokra after 3 and 6 h of salt and drought treatment, respectively. In response to cold stress, 14-3-3g expression",

Some recent reports have shown that plant 14-3-3s are regulated by multiple stress pathways, including cold, salinity and wound (Liu et al. 2016). Localization of the 14-3-3 family members inside organelles such as chloroplasts (Sehnke et al. 2000), nucleus (Bihn et al. 1997) and mitochondria (Sehnke and Ferl 2000), as well as in the cytoplasm (Bihn et al. 1997), further demonstrates their global regulatory potential and their apparent diversity in expression and function. Identification and characterization of a large set of the 14-3-3 family in Arabidopsis (DeLille et al. 2001) followed by several other species have shown phylogenetically diverse epsilon and non-epsilon group of isoforms. Hence, comparative studies among isoforms within and among taxa are necessary to understand the evolution and further functional diversity in 14-3-3 genes. Our results provide the first comprehensive report for genome-wide molecular and phylogenetic characterization of 14-3-3 isoforms in some selected taxa\n\n© Springer",

However, amino acids facing the outside of the 14-3-3 molecule are relatively less conserved in all plant lineages as similarly reported earlier among vertebrates, yeast and plants (Liu et al. 1995). The amino acids in the dimerization domains are not completely conserved which might indicate differences in dimer formation between isoforms. From alignment results, it was noted that all 14-3-3 isoforms of different plant lineages showed the presence of α-helices, typical in the 14-3-3 structure. This reportedly serves as an amphipathic groove for attachment of the polypeptide chain of the target protein and NES (nuclear export signal) that interacts with chromosome maintenance region 1 (Crm1) and nuclear pore that further drives 14-3-3 and its target assemblage out of the nucleus (Fukuda et al. 1997).\n\nThe majority of 14-3-3 isoforms in rice were included in the non-epsilon group except Os14-3-3g and Os14-3-3h that clustered in the epsilon group. This indicated that some 14-3-3 genes (isoforms) in monocotyledon plants might be lost during the course of evolution. The retained one or two group 14-3-3 genes might play a conserved function in monocotyledon plants as similarly reported by other researchers (Tian et al. 2015). The majority of non-epsilon isoforms of different plant groups clustered tightly in Clade 4, indicating major independent duplication events leading to isoform diversification after the separation of the epsilon and non-epsilon branches (Fig. 2). The non-epsilon isoforms in rice clustered separately from the dicotyledonous group, indicating that monocot 14-3-3 isoforms are sequentially divergent and arise from independent gene duplication events (Wu et al. 1997). Since the non-epsilon isoforms can be found in all organisms in greater numbers, it is thought that this phylogenetic branch might be involved in basal eukaryotic 14-3-3 functions, while the epsilon group is involved in organism-specific 14-3-3 functions (Jaspert et al. 2011).\n\nOur synteny analysis showed only two Arabidopsis 14-3-3 orthologs (At14-3-3.5 and At14-3-3.7) to have syntenic pairing (13%) with only three O. sativa 14-3-3 isoforms (14-3-3b, 14-3-3c, and 14-3-3e). The tandem duplication events were found to be extremely low in 14-3-3 gene diversification. Therefore, an examination of the orthologous and paralogous sequences in both Arabidopsis and rice indicated that At14-3-3.5 and At14-3-3.7 and Os14-3-3b, Os14-3-3c and Os14-3-3e isoforms (with segmental duplication in paralogous sequences in both genomes) might be derived from a common ancestor, but underwent rapid differentiation and evolution after the separation of dicot and monocot species. The results also indicated that the timing of large-scale duplication events were less divergent, with values ranging from 17 to 35 million years ago (MYA), primarily in the past 30–40 MYA. These results were supported by a previous notion that Arabidopsis At14-3-3 isoforms have undergone two major duplication events about 170 and 50 MYA that led to gene arrangement and loss of isoforms (Rosenquist et al. 2001). The results also showed that four segmental duplication events as recorded in rice 14-3-3 genes were probably recent and close to the origination time of monocots (Blanc and Wolfe 2004; Yao et al. 2007). From the results of the sequence alignment and homology modeling, it appeared that the less conserved C-terminal domain was responsible for functional diversities between different isoforms (Fig. 6).\n\nInvolvement of the 14-3-3 isoforms in mitigating abiotic stress in plants has been a primary focus of research. A wide array of recent reports identified and confirmed the role of 14-3-3 genes in several abiotic stress responses in major plant lineages (Shanko et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2009; Campo et al. 2011; Sun et al. 2011; Ho et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2017). Evidence that 14-3-3 plays a major functional role in environmental stress responses comes from the overexpression of Arabidopsis 14-3-3 in cotton, resulting in drought-tolerant phenotype characterized by less wilting and higher transpiration and photosynthesis rate than wild type due to increased stomatal opening (Yan et al. 2004). Similarly, the 14-3-3 gene (TFT4) from tomato when overexpressed in Arabidopsis caused a significant increase in H+ efflux and the activity of plasma membrane H+-ATPase, and was reportedly involved in the regulation of H+ efflux and basipetal IAA transport under alkaline stress (Xu et al. 2013). Overexpression of Glycine soja 14-3-3 protein GsGF14o in Arabidopsis thaliana was shown to be involved in plant development and drought response via induced reduction of plant tolerance at seed germination and seedling growth stages (Sun et al. 2013, 2016). Recently, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing BdGF14a, one of the 14-3-3 isoforms from Brachypodium distachyon, exhibited an improved tolerance to drought stress with increased leaf water content and reduced electrolyte leakage (Yang et al. 2017). A previous report based on semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that 14-3-3s in japonica rice was differentially inducible by abiotic stress and heavy metals (Yao et al. 2007). The role of GF14c in drought tolerance was confirmed experimentally by the transgenic approach. Overexpression of GF14c enhanced drought tolerance in transgenic rice seedlings and GF14c was also demonstrated to function under the control of OsCDPK1, a calcium-dependent protein kinase gene (Ho et al. 2013).\n\nIn our present results, both microarray and MPSS analysis revealed that 14-3-3 isoforms in Arabidopsis and rice were differentially expressed under various abiotic stress",

AAPK (ABA-activated protein kinase) elicits the binding of the 14-3-3 protein to the 61 kDa protein in vitro when AAPK in guard cells is activated by ABA (Takahashi et al. 2007). One important effect of the ABA signaling pathway is to increase the expression of genes necessary to mitigate or tolerate these stresses (Chandler and Robertson 1994). 14-3-3s is also reported to interact with some of the transcription factors involved in ABA signal transduction (Chandler and Robertson 1994; Denison et al. 2011; He et al. 2017). These results indicated 14-3-3s to be an important candidate in ABA signal transduction, having a key role in abiotic stress response in plants and being possibly involved in both sensitive and tolerant rice cultivars, thus providing a new insight into the functional role of 14-3-3 isoforms in indica rice cultivars. In addition, gene expression results showed differential and isoform-specific expression of 14-3-3 genes at different developmental stages of plant growth. Our results of promoter analysis also showed the presence of abiotic stress-responsive elements such as MBS and bZIP binding site, indicating that 14-3-3s in rice is a potential candidate for stress-inducible gene expression under suitable environmental conditions. The presence of these elements in the upstream of 14-3-3 genes provides strong evidence about the role of 14-3-3s in diverse functions. These experimental results demonstrated that both Os14-3-3f and Os14-3-3g were highly inducible by salinity, drought and cold stress in abiotic stress-tolerant indica rice cultivars such as Nonabokra and N-22. These findings were supported by previous works that revealed the involvement\n\nregimes in lamina and root tissue. Data from semi-quantitative RT-PCR and qPCR confirmed that both Os14-3-3f and Os14-3-3g were highly inducible by salinity, drought and cold stress in Nonabokra and N-22 cultivars, but with different magnitudes in the shoot and root tissue, especially after 3–6 h of exposure. However, 14-3-3f was found to be upregulated in both lamina and roots of IR29 after 6 h of ABA treatment. Relatively higher expression of 14-3-3g was found in roots than in shoots of Nonabokra and N-22 after salt and dehydration stress. Increased accumulation of Os14-3-3f protein in Nonabokra and N-22 compared to IR29 under salinity and dehydration and more intensely in cold stress condition confirmed our observation that Os14-3-3f could have diverse roles and might be a key element in abiotic stress physiology. Immunoblot assays demonstrated that Os14-3-3f protein accumulated nearly in all stages of plant growth with the highest expression in panicles, mature roots and stems, thereby indicating its requirement in plant growth and metabolism. We also noted that the expression of 14-3-3g increased after ABA treatment in the lamina and root samples of all three rice cultivars up to 6 h of treatment. A relatively high transcript abundance was detected in the roots of IR29 after ABA treatment. In addition, isoforms Os14-3-3f and Os14-3-3g had differential expression levels at different stages of growth. Low levels of 14-3-3 (f and g) gene expression under abiotic stress treatments, but an elevated response after exogenous ABA in IR29 (sensitive) indicated a strong correlation of gene expression and ABA level. Generally, the intercellular or endogenous ABA concentration in leaves increased 10- to 50-fold within a few hours of the onset of water deficit, caused by high osmoticum, high NaCl or drying (dehydration).\n\nA major pathway activated by stresses such as drought, temperature and salt is the ABA signaling pathway that regulates the physiology from the seed to adult plant (Nakashima and Yamaguchi-Shinozaki 2013; Raghavendra et al. 2017). ABA is an essential mediator for triggering plant responses to adverse environmental stimuli (Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki 2006). Under drought stress conditions, ABA promotes stomatal closure to prevent water loss. Transcriptional monitoring of 14-3-3f and 14-3-3g and in silico analysis of promoter upstream confirmed its high expression in tolerant indica rice cultivars under salinity, dehydration and cold",

Phylogenetic studies revealed that segmental duplication events contributed to gene duplication, especially in rice, that might have occurred during evolution of monocot species. Transcriptional expression studies showed that 14-3-3f and 14-3-3g isoforms were inducible by salinity, dehydration and cold stress in stress-tolerant indica rice cultivars with differential expression levels. These results were indicative of the presence of a more complex cross talk between different signaling pathways regulated by 14-3-3-ligand complexes in response to abiotic stress in rice. Global interactome studies coupled with functional analysis of interaction complex under different abiotic stress regime in stress-tolerant rice cultivars would reveal isoform(s)-specific putative interacting partners of 14-3-3s. The present work not only provided a better understanding of the evolutionary processes of 14-3-3 genes in Arabidopsis and rice, but also offered a new insight into the role of 14-3-3 genes in response to abiotic stresses in indica rice cultivars.\n\n### Author contribution statement\nConceived and designed the experiments: NY, SB, SC and DNSG.

Phylogenetic studies revealed that segmental duplication events contributed to gene duplication, especially in rice, that might have occurred during evolution of monocot species. Transcriptional expression studies showed that 14-3-3f and 14-3-3g isoforms were inducible by salinity, dehydration and cold stress in stress-tolerant indica rice cultivars with differential expression levels. These results were indicative of the presence of a more complex cross talk between different signaling pathways regulated by 14-3-3-ligand complexes in response to abiotic stress in rice. Global interactome studies coupled with functional analysis of interaction complex under different abiotic stress regime in stress-tolerant rice cultivars would reveal isoform(s)-specific putative interacting partners of 14-3-3s. The present work not only provided a better understanding of the evolutionary processes of 14-3-3 genes in Arabidopsis and rice, but also offered a new insight into the role of 14-3-3 genes in response to abiotic stresses in indica rice cultivars.",
