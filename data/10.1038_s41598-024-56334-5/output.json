This study aimed to assess the effect of exosomes\n                             on the release of pro‑inflammatory cytokines in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19)\n                             and compare it with a control group. The cytokines evaluated in this study were TNF‑α, IL‑6, IL‑17,\n                             and IFN‑γ. The study compared the levels of these pro‑inflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood\n                             mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of five COVID‑19 patients in the intensive care unit, who were subjected to\n                             both inactivated SARS‑CoV‑2 and exosome therapy, with those of five healthy controls. The cytokine\n                             levels were quantified using the ELISA method. The collected data was analyzed in SPSS Version\n                             26.0 and GraphPad Prism Version 9. According to the study findings, when PBMCs were exposed\n                             to inactivated SARS‑CoV‑2, pro‑inflammatory cytokines increased in both patients and healthy\n                             controls. Notably, the cytokine levels were significantly elevated in the COVID‑19 patients compared\n                             to the control group P‑values were<0.001, 0.001, 0.008, and 0.008 for TNF‑α, IL‑6, IL‑17, and IFN‑\n                             γ, respectively. Conversely, when both groups were exposed to exosomes, there was a marked\n                             reduction in the levels of pro‑inflammatory cytokines. This suggests that exosome administration can\n                             effectively mitigate the hyperinflammation induced by COVID‑19 by suppressing the production of\n                             pro‑inflammatory cytokines in patients.

This study aimed to assess the effect of exosomes on the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and compare it with a control group. The cytokines evaluated in this study were TNF-α, IL-6, IL-17, and IFN-γ. The study compared the levels of these pro-inflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of five COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit, who were subjected to both inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and exosome therapy, with those of five healthy controls. The cytokine levels were quantified using the ELISA method. The collected data was analyzed in SPSS Version 26.0 and GraphPad Prism Version 9. According to the study findings, when PBMCs were exposed to inactivated SARS-CoV-2, pro-inflammatory cytokines increased in both patients and healthy controls. Notably, the cytokine levels were significantly elevated in the COVID-19 patients compared to the control group P-values were<0.001, 0.001, 0.008, and 0.008 for TNF-α, IL-6, IL-17, and IFN-γ, respectively. Conversely, when both groups were exposed to exosomes, there was a marked reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This suggests that exosome administration can effectively mitigate the hyperinflammation induced by COVID-19 by suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in patients. These findings underscore the potential safety and efficacy of exosomes as a therapeutic strategy for COVID-19.\n\n**Keywords** Cytokine storm, SARS-CoV-2, Exosome, COVID-19, PBMC\n\n**Abbreviations**",

This virus causes a type\n                                           of pneumonia infection known as coronavirus disease 2019, which became a major global health   concern¹.\n                                           COVID-19 triggers intense immune responses and promotes uncontrolled cytokine release, resulting in cytokine\n                                           storms in the\n                                                              lungs². Current evidence suggests that lymphopenia (a condition characterized by low levels of\n                                           lymphocytes in the blood) and increased levels of circulating cytokines are key factors in the progression of the\n                                           disease or recovery from it\n                                                                        3–6. As such, strategies aimed at controlling cytokine release and implementing anti-\n                                           inflammatory therapy could potentially serve as effective approaches for treating or mitigating pneumonia in\n                                           COVID-19  patients.\n                                                                7\n                                                       According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the majority of COVID-19 patients exhibit mild (40%)\n                                           to moderate (40%) symptoms. Conversely, about 15% of patients experience severe symptoms that necessitate\n                                           oxygen therapy, and 5% develop extremely severe symptoms.

Cytokine storms, which significantly contribute to\n                                           the progression of COVID-19 infection, are sustained and intensified by several concurrent processes, including\n                                           the activation of antigen-presenting cells (e.g., macrophages), alerting lymphocytes to the presence of the virus,\n                                           replication of viral RNA within host cells, production of pro-inflammatory factors, and invasion of lymphocytes\n                                           by the virus, which triggers lymphocyte apoptosis and thus facilitates continuous immune evasion\n                                                                                                                                                10.\n                                               Clinical data suggests that cytokine storms induced by COVID-19 involve a self-perpetuating cycle of inflam-\n                                           matory responses, characterized by the continuous release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1\n                                           (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-12 (IL-12), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha\n                                           (TNF-α), which adversely impact lung  tissues11–13. Stem cell-based therapies have been recently recognized as\n                                           innovative treatment strategies for managing patients with COVID-19¹⁴. A study by Leng et al. was the first to\n                                           showcase the therapeutic potential of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in enhancing the pulmonary\n                                           function of COVID-19\n                                                                         patients¹⁵. Over the past few decades, the potential mechanisms of MSCs in treating\n                                           various stages of respiratory diseases have been\n                                                                                               elucidated¹⁶. For instance, in multiple ARDS models, the anti-\n                                           inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties of MSCs have been shown to improve lung function by restoring\n                                           epithelial and endothelial cells and facilitating the clearance of alveolar edema fluid. Generally, MSCs are known\n                                           for their ability to secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-\n                                           β), leading to a reduction in the recruitment of neutrophils into damaged organs and a decrease in the levels of\n                                           pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-6¹⁷.\n                                                          Human umbilical cord-derived (hUC-MSCs) are the primary source of MSCs. According to previous stud-\n                                           ies, MSC therapies can effectively treat  ARDS    and\n                                                                                           18     sepsis¹⁹, which are oﬅen severe pathological symptoms in\n                                           COVID-19 patients. Patients may experience symptoms, such as edema, intrapulmonary shunting, and hypox\n                                                                                                                                                            -\n                                           emia. However, by regulating the inflammatory activity and preventing apoptosis, MSCs can help halt the pro-\n                                           gression of the disease\n                                                                  20. A study by Johnson et al.21 demonstrated that human MSC therapy can ameliorate ARDS\n                                           and sepsis in rats and mice. Furthermore, according to a phase I trial conducted by Zheng et al.    22 and Wilson\n                                           et al.²³, the administration of MSCs did not lead to any adverse side effects.

Additionally, in their respective clinical studies, both Lanzoni et al.\n                                                                                                                                                           26\n                                           and Feng et al.²⁷ reported encouraging results in COVID-19 patients treated with hUC-MSCs. MSCs utilize three\n                                           primary mechanisms to manage the symptoms of COVID-19, including immunomodulatory effects, reparative\n                                           and recovery effects, and antimicrobial effects, particularly in cases of ARDS and  sepsis²⁸.

This virus causes a type of pneumonia infection known as coronavirus disease 2019, which became a major global health concern¹. COVID-19 triggers intense immune responses and promotes uncontrolled cytokine release, resulting in cytokine storms in the lungs². Current evidence suggests that lymphopenia (a condition characterized by low levels of lymphocytes in the blood) and increased levels of circulating cytokines are key factors in the progression of the disease or recovery from it³⁻⁶. As such, strategies aimed at controlling cytokine release and implementing anti-inflammatory therapy could potentially serve as effective approaches for treating or mitigating pneumonia in COVID-19 patients⁷.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), the majority of COVID-19 patients exhibit mild (40%) to moderate (40%) symptoms. Conversely, about 15% of patients experience severe symptoms that necessitate oxygen therapy, and 5% develop extremely severe symptoms. These severe symptoms are characterized by serious complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, sepsis, septic shock, and multiorgan failure, which can include cardiac and critical kidney injuries. ARDS is primarily caused by the host's antiviral inflammatory responses, often triggered by cytokine storm syndrome. This can ultimately lead to multiorgan failure or even death in severe COVID-19 cases⁸,⁹. Cytokine storms, which significantly contribute to the progression of COVID-19 infection, are sustained and intensified by several concurrent processes, including the activation of antigen-presenting cells (e.g., macrophages), alerting lymphocytes to the presence of the virus, replication of viral RNA within host cells, production of pro-inflammatory factors, and invasion of lymphocytes by the virus, which triggers lymphocyte apoptosis and thus facilitates continuous immune evasion¹⁰.\n\nClinical data suggests that cytokine storms induced by COVID-19 involve a self-perpetuating cycle of inflammatory responses, characterized by the continuous release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-12 (IL-12), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), which adversely impact lung tissues¹¹⁻¹³. Stem cell-based therapies have been recently recognized as innovative treatment strategies for managing patients with COVID-19¹⁴. A study by Leng et al. was the first to showcase the therapeutic potential of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in enhancing the pulmonary function of COVID-19 patients¹⁵. Over the past few decades, the potential mechanisms of MSCs in treating various stages of respiratory diseases have been elucidated¹⁶. For instance, in multiple ARDS models, the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties of MSCs have been shown to improve lung function by restoring epithelial and endothelial cells and facilitating the clearance of alveolar edema fluid. Generally, MSCs are known for their ability to secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), leading to a reduction in the recruitment of neutrophils into damaged organs and a decrease in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-6¹⁷.\n\nHuman umbilical cord-derived (hUC-MSCs) are the primary source of MSCs. According to previous studies, MSC therapies can effectively treat ARDS¹⁸ and sepsis¹⁹, which are often severe pathological symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Patients may experience symptoms, such as edema, intrapulmonary shunting, and hypoxemia. However, by regulating the inflammatory activity and preventing apoptosis, MSCs can help halt the progression of the disease²⁰.

This virus causes a type of pneumonia infection known as coronavirus disease 2019, which became a major global health concern¹. COVID-19 triggers intense immune responses and promotes uncontrolled cytokine release, resulting in cytokine storms in the lungs². Current evidence suggests that lymphopenia (a condition characterized by low levels of lymphocytes in the blood) and increased levels of circulating cytokines are key factors in the progression of the disease or recovery from it³⁻⁶. As such, strategies aimed at controlling cytokine release and implementing anti-inflammatory therapy could potentially serve as effective approaches for treating or mitigating pneumonia in COVID-19 patients⁷.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), the majority of COVID-19 patients exhibit mild (40%) to moderate (40%) symptoms. Conversely, about 15% of patients experience severe symptoms that necessitate oxygen therapy, and 5% develop extremely severe symptoms. These severe symptoms are characterized by serious complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, sepsis, septic shock, and multiorgan failure, which can include cardiac and critical kidney injuries. ARDS is primarily caused by the host's antiviral inflammatory responses, often triggered by cytokine storm syndrome. This can ultimately lead to multiorgan failure or even death in severe COVID-19 cases⁸,⁹. Cytokine storms, which significantly contribute to the progression of COVID-19 infection, are sustained and intensified by several concurrent processes, including the activation of antigen-presenting cells (e.g., macrophages), alerting lymphocytes to the presence of the virus, replication of viral RNA within host cells, production of pro-inflammatory factors, and invasion of lymphocytes by the virus, which triggers lymphocyte apoptosis and thus facilitates continuous immune evasion¹⁰.\n\nClinical data suggests that cytokine storms induced by COVID-19 involve a self-perpetuating cycle of inflammatory responses, characterized by the continuous release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-12 (IL-12), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), which adversely impact lung tissues¹¹⁻¹³. Stem cell-based therapies have been recently recognized as innovative treatment strategies for managing patients with COVID-19¹⁴. A study by Leng et al. was the first to showcase the therapeutic potential of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in enhancing the pulmonary function of COVID-19 patients¹⁵. Over the past few decades, the potential mechanisms of MSCs in treating various stages of respiratory diseases have been elucidated¹⁶. For instance, in multiple ARDS models, the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties of MSCs have been shown to improve lung function by restoring epithelial and endothelial cells and facilitating the clearance of alveolar edema fluid. Generally, MSCs are known for their ability to secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), leading to a reduction in the recruitment of neutrophils into damaged organs and a decrease in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-6¹⁷.\n\nHuman umbilical cord-derived (hUC-MSCs) are the primary source of MSCs. According to previous studies, MSC therapies can effectively treat ARDS¹⁸ and sepsis¹⁹, which are often severe pathological symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Patients may experience symptoms, such as edema, intrapulmonary shunting, and hypoxemia. However, by regulating the inflammatory activity and preventing apoptosis, MSCs can help halt the progression of the disease²⁰. A study by Johnson et al.²¹ demonstrated that human MSC therapy can ameliorate ARDS and sepsis in rats and mice. Furthermore, according to a phase I trial conducted by Zheng et al.²² and Wilson et al.²³, the administration of MSCs did not lead to any adverse side effects. Guo et al. discovered that treating patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms using hUC-MSCs can enhance clinical outcomes by increasing the oxygenation levels and mitigating the incidents of cytokine storms²⁴.\n\nSimilarly, Liang et al. reported that the allogeneic use of hUC-MSCs can alleviate inflammatory symptoms in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia²⁵. Additionally, in their respective clinical studies, both Lanzoni et al.²⁶ and Feng et al.²⁷ reported encouraging results in COVID-19 patients treated with hUC-MSCs. MSCs utilize three primary mechanisms to manage the symptoms of COVID-19, including immunomodulatory effects, reparative and recovery effects, and antimicrobial effects, particularly in cases of ARDS and sepsis²⁸. Despite significant progress, stem cell-based therapies face several obstacles that limit their clinical application, such as immunogenicity, restricted sources of derivation, and ethical considerations. Furthermore, it is widely recognized that the success and effectiveness of stem cell-based therapies in treating COVID-19 largely depend on their paracrine effects and their ability to regulate cytokine storms¹⁴,²⁹,³⁰.\n\nExosomes, which are secreted by MSCs, are among the most crucial paracrine effectors. They carry biological cargos similar to their parent cells and possess healing properties, making them appealing substitutes for MSCs in treating various diseases³¹. Exosomes offer several benefits over their parent cells, including their small size, non-toxic nature, low immunogenicity (lacking MHC class I–II), high stability, and ease of storage. Furthermore, exosomes can be easily engineered and manipulated, and they can be produced as readily available products¹⁰,³². These advantages have contributed to the growing use of exosomes in clinical applications as new therapeutic alternatives³³.\n\nExosomes, which are produced by cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, contain viral RNA, key viral proteins, and host cell proteins, such as ACE-2. These components are essential for the virus to enter cells and propagate the infection.

Additionally, exosomes could serve as effective drug carriers in\n                                the treatment of COVID-19³⁴. Moreover, exosomes increase the count of anti-inflammatory signaling mediators,\n                                which could potentially reduce lung damage by enhancing the functional characteristics and permeability of\n                                the alveolar\n                                       epithelium35,36.

In addition to\n                                their effects observed in preclinical models of acute lung disorders, exosomes derived from MSCs were found\n                                to directly inhibit viral replication\n                                                                  35,37.\n                                   Alipoor et al. provided compelling experimental evidence that exosomes, derived from stem cells, have the\n                                ability to inhibit signaling pathways associated with hypoxia\n                                                                                           38.

This miRNA acts as a silencing complex and alters the\n                                expression of cellular receptors through epigenetic modifications. This process inhibits various RNA viruses,\n                                including coronavirus, influenza, and hepatitis C, from invading the\n\n                                                                                                 body35,39.

As observed under an inverted microscope, hUC-MSCs are elongated and\n                                spindle-shaped, forming compact clusters of uniform size. We investigated the of the immunophenotypes of\n                                MSCs using flow cytometry, a crucial biochemical method for understanding cell types. As depicted in Fig.  2,\n                                very high expression levels of CD44 and CD90 were detected, while very low expression levels were observed\n                                for CD34 and CD45.

The resulting value, determined\n                                from the protein concentration standard curve depicted in Fig. 4, was measured to be 3482 µg/mL.\n\n                                Dynamic light scattering technology (DLS)\n                                The size distribution of the isolated exosomes was determined using the DLS. The DLS analysis revealed that the\n                                average size of the exosomes was 89.65 nm, with measurements taken at a constant temperature of 25 °C (Fig.\n                                                                                                                                           5).\n\n                                Western blot analysis\n                                The Western blot analysis detected the presence of CD9, a surface marker typically found on exosomes derived\n                                from MSCs. The protein content of the exosomes can be assessed by flow cytometry and Western blot, and the\n                                combination of these two methods results in an investigation of both the membrane-bound (CD9, CD63, and\n                                CD81) and internalized proteins (Tsg101 and Alix) of the exosomes. Detection of proteins enriched in exosomes,\n                                such as CD9, Tsg101, and Alix, and the absence of proteins, such as the endoplasmic reticulum protein calnexin,\n                                is an indication that the exosome-enriched pellet is indeed exosomes and not contaminating vesicles from other\n\n                                Figure 1.   hUC-MSC morphology in culture conditions (× 100). hUC-MSC, Human umbilical cord-derived\n                                mesenchymal stem cells.\n\nScientific Reports|   (2024) 14:5724 |              https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-56334-5                                               3\n                                                                                                                                        Vol.:(0123456789)",

The healthy controls consisted of five individuals who neither contracted the virus during the epidemic, nor received a vaccine for prevention. In the patient group, three individuals (60%) were men, and two (40%) were women. The healthy group also comprised five individuals, including one (20%) man and four (80%) women.\n\n## Investigation of hematology, biochemistry, and coagulation tests in people with COVID‑19\n\nUpon admission to the ICU, the patients were subjected to laboratory tests to determine their white blood cell (WBC) and platelet (PLT) counts, as well as their blood erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and D-dimer levels (Table 1).\n\n## Efficacy of exosome treatment in reducing pro‑inflammatory cytokines\n\nThe levels of four cytokines were measured in the culture supernatants of PBMCs. These conditions include 1. exposure of PBMCs to the RPMI 1640 medium as a negative control, 2. exposure of PBMCs to the inactivated virus, 3. treatment with exosomes after exposure to the negative control (RPMI 1640 medium), and 4. treatment with exosomes after exposure to the inactivated virus in both patients and healthy participants. To begin with, due to our small sample size, the Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess the distribution of cytokines' levels in each group in patients and healthy participants. An independent T-test was performed for variables with normal distribution, and for others Mann–Whitney was used to compare the cytokine levels. Results are shown in Tables 2 and 3. All our results demonstrated a significant difference between patient and healthy participants for each condition except for TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-17 levels in PBMCs exposed to inactivated virus and treated by exosome P-values were 0.055, 0.327, and 0.627 respectively. We used paired T-test and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test to compare cytokines' levels before and after PBMCs exposure to the inactivated virus and before and after PBMCs treatment with exosome. We observed a notable decrease in the levels of cytokines among the patient\n\nScientific Reports| (2024) 14:5724 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-56334-5",

The cell viabilities mean values after 72 h for 10 µL, 20 µL, 40 µL, 60 µL dose of the isolated exosomes and control were 70.04 ± 0.030, 74.14 ± 0.043, 81.23 ± 0.033, 77.24 ± 0.029 and 100.00 ± 0.033, respectively. PBMC, Peripheral blood mononuclear cells.\n\n| Concentration(µl/ml) | Viability (%) |\n| -------------------- | ------------- |\n| Control              | 100           |\n| 10 µl/ml             | 70            |\n| 20 µl/ml             | 75            |\n| 40 µl/ml             | 80            |\n| 60 µl/ml             | 77            |\n\ngroup. Additionally, we found a significant reduction in cytokine levels among healthy controls whose PBMCs were stimulated with inactivated virus. P-values and effect sizes for these observations are available in Tables 4 and 5. The findings suggested that when PBMCs were stimulated with the inactivated virus for 24 h, there was a significant increase in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Individuals with symptomatic COVID-19 had higher levels of four cytokines (IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL17) than healthy controls. In Fig. 8, the expression levels of cytokines (IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL17) were displayed for patients and healthy individuals under four different conditions mentioned above.\n\nTable 1.

Based\n                                 on our findings, a therapeutic strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection could effectively involve immunomodulatory\n                                 treatment to regulate cytokine responses, in conjunction with antiviral treatment. Current evidence suggests that\n                                 administering exosomes is beneficial for patients with hyperinflammation induced by COVID-19. This is due to\n                                 the inhibition of the production of several cytokines, specifically IFN-γ and TNF-α, by activated T lymphocytes.\n                                 The results revealed that the levels of these cytokines were elevated in the culture supernatants of PBMCs from\n                                 COVID-19 patients compared to those from healthy controls; this suggests that these cytokines could contribute\n                                 to the pathogenesis of the disease. Furthermore, increased levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α have been linked to the\n                                 severity of COVID-19, reinforcing their potential role in disease progression. Several clinical studies have found\n                                 a correlation between the severity and mortality of COVID-19 and hyperinflammation. This hyperinflamma-\n                                 tion is marked by increased serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Postmortem analyses\n                                 have shown that high concentrations of these pro-inflammatory cytokines are associated with the infiltration\n                                 of cells into organs, such as the kidneys, heart, and lungs\n                                                                                                40–42.

Based on our findings, a therapeutic strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection could effectively involve immunomodulatory treatment to regulate cytokine responses, in conjunction with antiviral treatment. Current evidence suggests that administering exosomes is beneficial for patients with hyperinflammation induced by COVID-19. This is due to the inhibition of the production of several cytokines, specifically IFN-γ and TNF-α, by activated T lymphocytes.\n\nThe results revealed that the levels of these cytokines were elevated in the culture supernatants of PBMCs from COVID-19 patients compared to those from healthy controls; this suggests that these cytokines could contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Furthermore, increased levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α have been linked to the severity of COVID-19, reinforcing their potential role in disease progression. Several clinical studies have found a correlation between the severity and mortality of COVID-19 and hyperinflammation. This hyperinflammation is marked by increased serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Postmortem analyses have shown that high concentrations of these pro-inflammatory cytokines are associated with the infiltration of cells into organs, such as the kidneys, heart, and lungs⁴⁰⁻⁴². Furthermore, Han et al. conducted a study where they observed cytokine storms, characterized by elevated serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6⁴³. These storms were suggested to be indicators of the severity of the disease.

The cultures were then placed in a CO2 incubator at a temperature of 37 °C. The culture media were renewed every three days. After observing tiny clumps of cells around the pieces on days 5–7, the culture medium was renewed every other day for up to seven days23. The passage was iterated three times to achieve a uniform cell population. It was then sent to the laboratory to confirm the presence of CD34, CD44, CD45, and CD90 surface markers.

Representative images were selected\n                                based on their ability to accurately allocate the overall characteristics observed in the various fields of view.\n\n                                The bicinchoninic acid assay protein assay\n                                The total exosome content was extracted for quantification with a Bicinchoninic (BCA) Acid Protein Assay Kit\n                                (DNA Biotech, Iran), consisting of a standard solution, copper, and BCA reagents. The standard curve was plotted\n                                at different levels (50–250 µg/mL) against bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard solution. The exosomes\n                                and standard solutions were separately mixed with a mixture of copper and BCA reagents at a ratio of 1:50 and\n                                incubated at 60 °C for 60 min. Finally, the absorbance of the samples was read with a spectrophotometer at 562\n                                nm (MPR4 + ; Hyperion, Roeder mark, Germany).\n\n                                DLS technology\n                                The size of the exosomes was determined using DLS with a Zeta device (Malvern Instruments, UK). PBS, with\n                                a refractive index of 33.1 and viscosity of 1.08, was used as the solvent. These parameters are essential for the\n                                device soﬅware to analyze the data. This simple, rapid, and nondestructive method, can measure particles rang-\n                                ing from a few nanometers to micrometers. The exosomes were diluted five times, and the sample was then read\n                                and analyzed using the Zetasizer APS.\n\n                                Western blot analysis\n                                The protein production was confirmed using the Western blotting analysis. For this purpose, the samples were\n                                centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C to eliminate the lysate. The protein concentration was measured\n                                using the BCA Protein Quantification Kit, following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Equal vol-\n                                umes of lysate and Laemmli 2X sample buffer were combined, and then, 20 µg of this mixture was boiled for five\n                                minutes. Subsequently, it was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a 0.2-µm membrane (Immun-BlotTM,\n                                PVDF). Next, the membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in 0.1% Tween 20 for one hour and incubated with\n                                anti-CD9 (Cat.

The membranes were washed with TBST three times and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (H&L)\n                                secondary antibody. They were then incubated with enhanced chemiluminescence immunoassay for 1–2 min.\n\n                                MTT assay\n                                The cytotoxicity of exosomes was evaluated using the colorimetric MTT assay. For this purpose, 100 µL of DMEM\n                                culture medium containing\n                                                           10⁶ PBMCs was added to each well of a 96-well plate. The MTT assay was performed\n                                aﬅer 72 h by adding 100 μL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL in PBS) into each well. The cells were then incubated for\n                                four hours. The MTT solution was removed, and 100 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma‒Aldrich, USA)\n                                was added to each well to dissolve the purple formazan crystals. The cytotoxic activity of exosomes was then\n                                evaluated by a standard MTT assay. The optical absorbance at 570 nm was measured using a microplate reader\n                                (ELISA reader, ELX808, BioTek). The results were reported as the rate of viability based on the concentration\n                                curve. All tests were performed in three iterations. The relative cell viability was calculated as follows: Relative\n                                cell viability (%)\n                                                 = (ODs/ODc) × 100.\n\n                                Patients and sample collection\n                                The relative cell viability was calculated as follows: Blood samples were collected from five COVID-19 patients\n                                admitted to the ICU, who were selected between July and October 2021 in Tehran, Iran. The inclusion criteria\n                                were a positive real-time PCR result with a CT value of 15–25, an age range of 20–40 years, and no history of any\n                                underlying diseases. Tests for CBC, CRP, ESR, D-dimer, and IL-6 were conducted to ensure that the patients were\n                                in similar conditions in terms of disease severity. The exclusion criteria were any dissatisfaction with sampling\n                                on the part of the patients and any deterioration in the patient’s condition.\n\n                                Isolation and culture of PBMCs\n                                Three milliliters of blood, treated with heparin, was collected from the patients and then diluted with an equal\n                                volume of PBS.

They were then incubated for 72 h.\n\nScientific Reports|   (2024) 14:5724 |              https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-56334-5                                             11\n                                                                                                                                       Vol.:(0123456789)",
      "md": "Subsequently, they were loaded on a formvar/carbon-covered mesh and contrasted with 2% uranyl acetate. Multiple fields of view were examined for both FESEM and TEM imaging. Representative images were selected based on their ability to accurately allocate the overall characteristics observed in the various fields of view.\n\n## The bicinchoninic acid assay protein assay\n\nThe total exosome content was extracted for quantification with a Bicinchoninic (BCA) Acid Protein Assay Kit (DNA Biotech, Iran), consisting of a standard solution, copper, and BCA reagents. The standard curve was plotted at different levels (50–250 µg/mL) against bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard solution. The exosomes and standard solutions were separately mixed with a mixture of copper and BCA reagents at a ratio of 1:50 and incubated at 60 °C for 60 min. Finally, the absorbance of the samples was read with a spectrophotometer at 562 nm (MPR4 + ; Hyperion, Roeder mark, Germany).\n\n## DLS technology\n\nThe size of the exosomes was determined using DLS with a Zeta device (Malvern Instruments, UK). PBS, with a refractive index of 33.1 and viscosity of 1.08, was used as the solvent. These parameters are essential for the device software to analyze the data. This simple, rapid, and nondestructive method, can measure particles ranging from a few nanometers to micrometers. The exosomes were diluted five times, and the sample was then read and analyzed using the Zetasizer APS.\n\n## Western blot analysis\n\nThe protein production was confirmed using the Western blotting analysis. For this purpose, the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C to eliminate the lysate. The protein concentration was measured using the BCA Protein Quantification Kit, following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Equal volumes of lysate and Laemmli 2X sample buffer were combined, and then, 20 µg of this mixture was boiled for five minutes. Subsequently, it was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a 0.2-µm membrane (Immun-BlotTM, PVDF). Next, the membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in 0.1% Tween 20 for one hour and incubated with anti-CD9 (Cat. No.: ab223052, Abcam) and anti-calnexin control antibodies (Cat. No.: ab133615, Abcam) to show the purity of the extracted exosome from contaminated cellular components, at room temperature for one hour. The membranes were washed with TBST three times and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (H&L) secondary antibody. They were then incubated with enhanced chemiluminescence immunoassay for 1–2 min.\n\n## MTT assay\n\nThe cytotoxicity of exosomes was evaluated using the colorimetric MTT assay. For this purpose, 100 µL of DMEM culture medium containing 10⁶ PBMCs was added to each well of a 96-well plate. The MTT assay was performed after 72 h by adding 100 μL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL in PBS) into each well. The cells were then incubated for four hours. The MTT solution was removed, and 100 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma‒Aldrich, USA) was added to each well to dissolve the purple formazan crystals. The cytotoxic activity of exosomes was then evaluated by a standard MTT assay. The optical absorbance at 570 nm was measured using a microplate reader (ELISA reader, ELX808, BioTek). The results were reported as the rate of viability based on the concentration curve. All tests were performed in three iterations. The relative cell viability was calculated as follows: Relative cell viability (%) = (ODs/ODc) × 100.\n\n## Patients and sample collection\n\nThe relative cell viability was calculated as follows: Blood samples were collected from five COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU, who were selected between July and October 2021 in Tehran, Iran. The inclusion criteria were a positive real-time PCR result with a CT value of 15–25, an age range of 20–40 years, and no history of any underlying diseases. Tests for CBC, CRP, ESR, D-dimer, and IL-6 were conducted to ensure that the patients were in similar conditions in terms of disease severity. The exclusion criteria were any dissatisfaction with sampling on the part of the patients and any deterioration in the patient's condition.\n\n## Isolation and culture of PBMCs\n\nThree milliliters of blood, treated with heparin, was collected from the patients and then diluted with an equal volume of PBS. This mixture was then added to 2 mL of Ficoll® (Innotriane, Germany) and centrifuged at 2400 rpm for 20 min. The PBMCs, which appeared as a cloudy layer between the Ficoll® and the diluted blood, were carefully collected using a Pasteur pipette. The collected cells were suspended in 2 mL of PBS and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min to remove Ficoll®; this step was repeated at 1000 rpm to remove platelets.\n\n## PBMCs exposed to inactivated virus\n\nFollowing a 3-hour incubation period, the PBMCs from each patient were cultivated in six wells. The titer of SARS-CoV-2 was determined to be 10⁷·⁶⁶ ID₅₀/mL. Three of the PBMC culture wells were exposed to 0.3 µL of inactivated SARS-CoV-2, while the remaining three wells, which contained PBMCs but were not exposed to the virus, served as negative controls (RPMI 1640 medium).\n\n## PBMCs exposed to exosomes\n\nAfter 24 h, the cell supernatant was collected, centrifuged, and stored at −80 °C until further evaluation. Subsequently, 40 µg/mL of exosomes was added to the wells containing the control sample from a healthy individual, as well as to the other wells containing patient samples. They were then incubated for 72 h.",

This was accomplished using the ELISA method, with the Human Cytokines Measurement Kit.\n\n## Statistical analysis\n\nThe gathered data was analyzed using SPSS Version 26.0 and GraphPad Prism 9. An independent sample t-test was employed to compare the mean values between patient and healthy participants. For data with a nonparametric distribution, the Mann–Whitney U test was used for analysis. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. For data with normal distribution and for non-parametrical data Paired t-tests and Wilcoxon were respectively performed to evaluate effects of exosome treatment in cytokines levels variations. Continuous variables were expressed as either the mean with standard deviation or the median with interquartile range. Categorical variables were represented as frequency percentages.\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe corresponding author will provide supporting data via email upon request by editors or referees.
