      "text": "This is the last of three papers that the Human Dimension Capabilities Development Task Force (HDCDTF) will be producing on social intelligence (SI) in 2016. The first paper, published in February 2016, discussed the historical and theoretical development of SI. It sketched an outline of existing research that has attempted to define SI. The paper provided readers with the appropriate context—including important findings, challenges, and limitations that others have revealed and encountered in the scientific and popular literature—to consider as the Army, and particularly its Human Dimension efforts, develops and executes its interest in the concept.\n\nThe second paper, published in May 2016, examined how scholars and practitioners from a variety of fields have attempted to distinguish SI from the seemingly similar concept of emotional intelligence (EI). Both concepts have received significant attention from a broad audience, including the Army; however, common conceptualizations of each are often conflated. In order for the Army to approach its interest in SI and EI deliberately and effectively, it is important to discuss how the relationship between SI and EI has been described in the scientific and popular literature. In short, the existing research on the relationship between SI and EI is inconsistent and at times contradictory. This paper addressed these concerns and provided a waypoint from which the Army can expand its interest and understanding of SI and EI and their potential relationship to each other.\n\nThe third paper, presented here, investigates methods that the Army might consider implementing or learning from that attempt to (1) assess social intelligence in individuals and (2) develop or improve social intelligence in individuals. Supporting Objective #1.2 (\"Social Intelligence\") in The Army Human Dimension Strategy, which charges the Army to, \"Develop trusted Army Professional as effective team members who thrive in complex social environments, adapt to diverse cultures, communicate effectively, and build relationships,\" provides the catalyst for the series and serves as the ultimate goal of its research.¹\n\nThe US Army's interest in the Human Dimension requires critical consideration of extant research on measuring and developing SI in individuals. While an important takeaway is the lack of any pre-existing, all-in-one programs for measuring or developing SI, a number of key lessons emerge that can benefit the Army’s Human Dimension initiative as it continues to investigate and develop efforts to address its interest in SI and prepare for the complex and changing OE of the future."

      "text": "First, the design of SI measures often dictates their utility for a given population or purpose. In this sense, the context of the test questions (socially-specific vs. socially-general, for example) matter greatly, as does its linkage to specific job tasks and organizational outcomes. A test intended for a specific Army leadership cohort looks much different than one intended for all new Army recruits.\n\nSecond, SI assessments should reflect the multidimensional nature of SI. Most scholars now agree that SI is a multidimensional construct that consists of cognitive and behavioral components. Adopting or acknowledging a multidimensional definition of SI, which we propose, can partially address this concern. Ideally, a test of SI would consist of multiple subtests to be able to accurately measure both components and thereby create a composite SI factor. As the literature reveals, however, this is a complex endeavor and has so far proved difficult. If a multidimensional measure of SI is impracticable, any test the Army considers ought to be couched in a multidimensional conceptualization or theoretical framework of SI and expressly state which component(s) of SI it is addressing.\n\nThird, the format of the SI measurement test is important. Each format has strengths and weaknesses that need to be acknowledged and accounted for in the test design. Multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) designs that incorporate multiple formats to offset potential variance caused by any single format have emerged as promising and scientifically rigorous measures of SI. Furthermore, nonverbal measures are believed to be especially critical to assessing SI so that the construct is not conflated with traditional measures of IQ that rely largely on written questions and answers. A promising development in this regard is the increased use of a variety of more advanced and increasingly more available multimedia platforms that can be cheaply incorporated in the testing process (video and computer simulations, for instance).\n\nFinally, the lack of empirical research supporting any specific measure of SI prevents any similar claims of the effectiveness of SI development programs. Without any meaningful measure of SI, development tools or education programs intended to improve SI will remain problematic. However, the multidimensional approach to SI may facilitate developing components of SI where attempts to develop SI as a whole prove challenging. In this case, the most logical approach to training or developing SI is to target specific interpersonal and intrapersonal skills that are suggested as elements of SI and also considered critical to individual and team success for the Army.\n\nWith these observations in mind, as well as the literature reviewed here and in the previous two white papers on SI, the HDCDTF provides the following recommendations to the Army:"

Broadly, SI can be conceived as a combination of social awareness and effective social action necessary to achieve an individually- or organizationally- valued goal in a social setting. The U.S. Army is a dynamic organization, comprised of a diverse population, and faced with complex problems. Understanding and applying lessons from SI research may allow the Army to more effectively develop, manage, and prepare its force for the challenges of the future. Indeed, many of the characteristics of the future OE that the Army has outlined, including \"increased velocity and momentum of human interaction\" and \"operations among populations in cities,\" might be at least partially addressed through improved SI of its personnel.⁴ The complexity of these scenarios and the variety of stakeholders involved require more effective personnel, more effective leaders, and more effective teams. A century of research on SI, particularly its role in individual performance, informs current and future efforts to achieve mission success with the Army's complex social system and with those whom it interacts.\n\nMeasuring and training SI in individuals is a key concern of the Army’s interest in the SI. These are also primary topics of research and debate in the long history of SI, particularly interest in SI measurement mechanisms. It is logical for the Army to review and identify methods that effectively assess and develop SI in individuals that are appropriate to the Army’s needs and interests. This paper will highlight select lessons and insight from the legacy of SI research may ensure that the Army’s investment in the construct is sound and defensible, and rooted in the organizational value that SI literature provides. These methods may provide off-the-shelf options that the Army can utilize (or test) among its personnel, to include Soldiers and leaders. Established assessments and development mechanisms may also provide important insight and guidance for the Army if it was to consider developing its own products tailored specifically for the unique missions of its personnel.\n\nThis current white paper begins by providing a recommended working definition of SI and then reviews the available literature that addresses assessing and developing SI in individuals. Here, the Human Dimension Capabilities Task Force (HDCDTF) will describe key tools and methods that a variety of scholars and practitioners have developed to measure and train SI (or correlates of SI) in individuals in order to improve personal and organizational outcomes. The intent is to highlight key findings in the literature on SI, including methods to assess SI and considerations for attempting to improve it, that the\n\n³ Department of the Army, The Army Human Dimension Strategy 2015: Building Cohesive Teams to Win In A Complex World: Cognitive Dominance, Realistic Training, Institutional Agility, 2015, 1.\n\n⁴ Department of the Army, The U.S. Army Operating Concept: Win in a Complex World: 2020-2040, TRADOC Pamphlet 525-3-1, October 31, 2014, 11-12."

      "text": "This white paper emerges from the Army Human Dimension’s explicit interest in SI as a major component of its strategy to develop “cohesive teams of trusted professionals that improve and thrive in the ambiguity and chaos of 2025.”^5 More implicitly, HD and SI reflect the Army’s pivot towards achieving a “social edge” among its adversaries, real and potential, in the future OE.^6 Over the coming decades it is likely that the US Army may not be able to retain its current degree of technological and physical advantage.^7 As this superiority diminishes, and as discussed throughout this series of white papers, it will be necessary for the Army to retain a decisive edge in other ways.\n\nThe Army recognizes that one such opportunity is to develop more precise and more effective mechanisms to identify, recruit, train, promote, and manage its personnel by leveraging the lessons from research on SI. This paper and preceding papers provide examples of the relevance of existing research to help inform the Human Dimension Capability Needs Assessment (CAN) process and changes in evolving doctrine, training organization, materiel, leadership, personnel, and policy.\n\nSI is one of many efforts over the last century that attempts to account for individual abilities that go above and beyond what traditional intelligence (IQ) measures. Interest in SI focuses on the individual components (abilities, knowledge, skills, for instance) of social interaction that are thought to contribute to individual achievement. Given the success of established measures of cognitive intelligence (IQ, most notably) in predicting certain outcomes of human performance it is logical and valuable for the Army to pursue interest in a similar mediating construct for individual performance, including leadership, that might help it better manage its personnel and prepare for the changing OE of the future. SI and similar concepts that attempt to reveal what IQ cannot is a frontier of cognitive, behavioral, and organizational research that the Army is well reasoned to pursue.\n\nThe HDS establishes SI as one of the five supporting objectives to its “Agile and Adaptive Leaders” line of effort.^8 Here it charges the HD community to “[d]evelop trusted Army Professionals as effective team members who thrive in complex social environments,\n\nArmy may either implement outright or use to inform its own efforts as it continues to explore interest in SI."

However, as discussed in the previous two papers in this series, the Army has established skills related to SI (and other similar concepts, such as emotional intelligence) in doctrine and other key publications as central to leader effectiveness and Soldier performance and development.¹⁰ The most notable of these is perhaps ADRP 6-22: Army Leadership, which outlines the importance of empathy, self-control, emotional factors, balance, stability, and active listening as part of its Character-Presence-Intellect model of leadership.¹¹ Furthermore, human dimension skills, perspective taking, managing one's emotions, emotional awareness, emotional maturity, social competence, and social empathy are similar concepts related to SI that are highlighted throughout other official Army publications.¹² Indeed, it is not anything new that the Army relies on lessons from psychology, cognitive science, social science, business, and elsewhere about the affective and interpersonal components of human facility to inform its efforts and prepare its personnel for a variety of contingencies.\n\nThe Army’s Human Dimension initiative is unique, however, in that it is rooted in the notion that technology and physical superiority cannot generate knowledge and solve problems in and by themselves. Instead, the Human Dimension effort relies on the notion that the Army’s people, and most notably the synergy created through their relationships with one another, are critical components that the Army needs to focus on for generating and processing the right kinds of information needed to solve the complex and rapidly changing problems it faces now and will face in the future. A refined approach to managing the Total Force can propel the Army forward and help it maintain the advantage it currently enjoys in the OE of the future. The Army’s Human Dimension initiative has identified SI, including available methods to measure and develop it in individuals, as an important component of this effort.\n\nSI has been defined in a number of ways since it was first proposed.

While debate continues, what is most critical to take away from that discussion is that most scholars now agree that SI is multidimensional.¹³ That is, SI is comprised of cognitive elements and behavioral elements. As such, we propose the Army adopt as a working definition Marlowe’s multidimensional conceptualization of SI:\n\nThe ability to understand the feelings, thoughts, and behaviors of persons, including oneself, in interpersonal situations and to act appropriately upon that understanding.¹⁴\n\nThis definition reflects the multidimensional nature that most scholars currently agree SI consists of. “Ability to understand…” comprises the cognitive portion, while “…act appropriately…” comprises the behavioral element. Of course, this isn’t the definitive articulation of SI; future research and findings will (and should) drive continued debate concerning the precise conceptualization of SI. This definition, however, can provide a common understanding among Army professionals that they can all rely upon when considering or encountering the term “social intelligence.” We believe such a standardized reference point of SI is necessary in order to discuss and implement the Army’s interest in SI more effectively.\n\nWhat is also critical to take away from the first two white papers is that SI, EI, and similar concepts have been linked to individual job performance, leadership, and organizational outcomes. Indeed, such alternative intelligences are often touted in existing literature as a critical, untapped element of effective leadership and performance. This comprises the Army’s chief concern with SI: how might SI be used to better predict the success and performance of Army personnel?\n\nDespite this interest, and as the previous two white papers on SI have revealed, much of the existing research on SI remains incomplete, inconclusive, and at times contradictory. For instance, while there is evidence to support the notion that SI and EI are linked to leadership and performance many scholars argue that this evidence, as it has been presented thus far, is insufficient to demonstrate a direct relationship that proves anything above and beyond what existing measures of IQ and personality already exhibit.¹⁵,¹⁶ Furthermore, although research has progressed to generally establish SI’s"

In turn, this has made establishing the validity of SI and distinguishing it from academic intelligence the crucial issue in the literature. It remains unresolved. Due to SI’s conceptual ambiguity, it can often resemble, overlap, and generally be confused and conflated with similar constructs of alternative intelligence and “people skills” such as emotional intelligence, practical intelligence, social skills, and so forth. There has been some research attempting to establish the relationship among these seemingly similar concepts (most notably its relationship to emotional intelligence), but, again, the lack of clear overarching theories for any of these concepts, including SI, precludes many meaningful conclusions.¹⁸\n\nThe shortcomings in the SI literature touched upon here and detailed at length in the previous white papers are not meant to discourage interest in the concept. Rather, the reviews are intended to provide as comprehensive and objective an overview as possible of the key issues, including the limitations, concerning SI. These products should serve to better inform the Army as it explores methods to refine its approach to managing its personnel. Indeed, the social component of the Army—particularly compared to the technological or physical side—remains relatively unexploited. Existing IQ and personality constructs and measurements account for a significant portion of the human dimension. As a result, the Human Dimension Strategy¹⁹ and the US Army Operating Concept²⁰ both acknowledge that the Army must change how it recruits, trains, educates, and manages its Soldiers, leaders, and civilians. SI may be able to address, in part, some of the potential and performance that is unaccounted for in existing cognitive and personality constructs and measures. It is therefore essential that the Army understand the spectrum of findings available and established on SI.\n\nCritical elements of interest in SI and of particular concern for the Army are how to measure it and then how to develop or train it in individuals. Similar to existing literature on SI’s conceptualization and its relationship to emotional intelligence, there are limitations and contradictions regarding how best to measure and develop it.

As with definitions of SI, there are no perfect answers to this issue. Each method has virtues and limitations; we will attempt to explain them each in turn. The majority of the paper will consider SI measurement methods. Notably, there is limited empirical research on SI development programs (largely due to the lack of any agreed upon definition of SI, which is the key to advancing any development program). As such, there will be a brief discussion at the end of the paper discussing a number of important considerations regarding how to conceptualize and approach improving SI in individuals.\n\nOne way to help think about the variety of historic and contemporary SI measurement tools is by considering two broad taxonomic systems for each. This creates a kind of cross-classification of SI measurement tools that can help place each tool into different bins to more easily understand how they are designed and what benefits and limitations they each may have.\n\nOne feature of the tools is their method or format. This has been discussed indirectly in other segments of the current series on SI;²¹ most often, the HDCDTF white papers have discussed measurement formats when outlining the limitations of self-report studies. When an assessment design uses two different methods to measure SI it is called a \"multimethod\" study. This helps to account for variance in the results of the test that may be caused by any individual format.\n\nThe other feature of SI measurement tools that is important to consider is the specific dimension of SI that the mechanism purports to measure. As discussed previously, most contemporary psychometric conceptualizations of SI contend that the construct is multidimensional, consisting of both a cognitive (ability) component and a behavioral (affective action) component.²² A single test or measure is, as far as has been developed thus far, able to account for only one of these dimensions of SI. When a SI assessment tool consists of a battery of subtests that attempt to measure both of these dimensions (one at a time) in a broader measurement framework it is referred to as a \"multitrait\" test.

Some scholars argue that human social abilities are dependent on an infinite number of social contexts and therefore too complex to be bracketed by a single value on a scale and ranked against other individuals.34,35,36 Put more simply, there are myriad ways to be socially intelligent and it may undermine the value of these complex and nuanced skills by attempting to develop universal scores of human social ability.37 Thorndike recognized this possibility in his initial discussion of SI when he observed, \"...convenient tests of social intelligence are hard to devise...\"38\n\nDespite these challenges, researchers and laypeople alike intuitively believe that SI consists of abilities that are likely related to but also distinguishable from academic intelligence.39 Since SI was first proposed this belief has prodded scholars to attempt to solve these measurement problems in order to uncover possible correlations between conceptualizations of SI and performance and leadership, while also distinguishing it from academic intelligence and personality.40 Over the years, however, these failures served for many not to close the door on SI research and deny its validity but rather as an opportunity to develop and refine ever more sophisticated efforts to accurately assess it."

In this later edition, the “facial expression” and “social information” portions were dropped and the “sense of humor” subtest was added.^53,54 These are detailed in the table below (Figure 3).

Subtests of the George Washington Social Intelligence Test.⁵⁶\n\nAlmost immediately after the GWSIT was published, however, other scholars consistently demonstrated that the GWSIT correlated highly with academic intelligence. Weis and Süß explain that individual success on the GWSIT “appears to be less dependent on socially intelligent behavior and more on understanding the importance of certain social milieu.”⁵⁷ Perhaps most damning of all, E.L. Thorndike’s son, R.L. Thorndike, performed a series of tests among 500 students (at George Washington University, no less) that found the GWSIT primarily measured verbal ability, which correlated strongly to tests of academic intelligence. In a follow-on study R.L. Thorndike and his co-author concluded by stating that “it seems doubtful that any test which is predominantly verbal can measure social ability.”⁵⁸ As R.L. Thorndike suggests, the GWSIT’s resemblance to academic intelligence can at least be partially attributed to its paper-and-pencil format that relies heavily on verbal skills to address abstracted social contexts. The format taps into many of the same or related cognitive abilities that dictate IQ and relies, as Weis and Süß point out, on specific social knowledge rather than some distinct mental ability linked to social functioning.⁵⁹\n\nDespite these limitations, the GWSIT remained the most well-known measure of SI well into the 1960s. While the GWSIT as a whole has been largely discarded, portions of it have been used in contemporary MTMM tests of SI.

For instance, Weis and Süß used the CSIT as a measure of social understanding in their measure of SI, which included social memory and social knowledge components in addition to social understanding.⁹⁰ Keating used the CSIT as one of three indicators of written language SI to compare alongside three measures of IQ (incidentally, he found no evidence of SI’s construct validity with any of the measures he examined).⁹¹ While falling short of establishing SI’s distinctiveness, the CSIT represented an effort to separate the cognitive elements of SI from its behavioral elements and thereby acknowledge the multidimensional nature of the construct.\n\nAround the same time that Gough reintroduced Chapin’s Social Intelligence Test, Guilford’s team developed the Six Factor Tests of Social Intelligence. The tests, which were first published in 1966 and revised to the Four Factor Tests 10 years later, were rooted in Guilford’s “Structure of Intellect” model of human intelligence.⁹² This was one of the first attempts to comprehensively theorize social intelligence and then develop a measure based on that theory—most prior measurements and conceptualizations of social intelligence had been largely atheoretical. Guilford’s Structure of Intellect model was described in the first white paper in this series.⁹³ In short, Guilford believed that human intelligence was profoundly complex. Within his framework, he and his team identified 150 components of human mental ability.⁹⁴ Among these, 30 were directly"

Furthermore, while Guilford acknowledged the multidimensional nature of SI he also acknowledged that his tests measured cognitive ability only and had no component to measure behavioral action.101,102,103\n\nAs its name suggests, the original version of the test included six subtests. These were labeled: (1) expression grouping, (2) missing cartoons, (3) social translations, (4) cartoon predictions, (5) missing pictures, and (6) picture exchange.104 All but one of these subtests is nonverbal. The rest of them rely on photographs, cartoons, and recordings in order to avoid interference with verbal abilities in their assessment.105 As mentioned above, the test was marketed as a cognitive ability measure (as opposed to a behavioral measure) of SI. Figure 5 describes each of the six subtests. Over time, the measure was whittled down to the four most successful of these subtests: expression grouping, missing cartoons, social translations, and cartoon predictions.106 Zaccaro et al argue that the cartoon predictions and social translations subtests are the two most reliable and consistent of these subscales.107\n\nPyschology Journal: Practice and Research (Summer 2003): 142."

The results discussed here indicate that the Six and Four Factor Tests of SI do not satisfy this requirement.\n\nThe test is notable for its rigorous development and attention to theoretical integration, something that had largely been ignored up until then and has been all-too-often neglected since. As with the previous measures described here, subsequent MTMM designs of SI incorporated elements of the Six Factor Tests of SI. For instance, Zaccaro et al used \"cartoon predictions\" and \"social translations\" to inform his measure of SI. Wong et al¹²⁰ and Jones and Day¹²¹ both used the \"expression grouping\" for their measure of nonverbal SI and pictorial crystallized intelligence, respectively, while Lee et al¹²² used \"cartoon predictions\" for their measure of social inference. The continued use of various elements of the Six Factor Tests of SI credits its robust design, particularly its use of nonverbal scenarios; however, the test suffers from the same fundamental problems as previous tests in that scholars have been unable to use it to prove the validity of SI above and beyond existing measures of academic intelligence and personality traits.\n\nThe three early measures described in the pages above represent critical landmarks in SI research and measurement, despite their ultimate shortcomings. They highlight a few of the past attempts to measure SI since Thorndike first proposed the notion in 1920. Several of these other examples, like The Ability to Sell Test,¹²³ purported to measure SI in its entirety, while most, like The Dymond Ratings Test,¹²⁴ The Vineland Social Maturity Scale,¹²⁵ Gough’s Social Maturity Index,¹²⁶ and the Gilliland Measure of Sociability,¹²⁷ measure either vague, atheoretical analogues of SI, like social competence or social functioning, or more discrete components of SI found in broader conceptualizations, such as empathy and likeability.

The more rigorous of these studies, particularly the three described in detail above, provide lessons that inform more contemporary efforts to assess SI. As we have seen, many of these historical tools are in fact partially integrated in many newer designs either as a subtest of the actual assessment mechanism or as a measure to determine the design’s convergent validity.\n\nThe most notable of the lessons culled from the experiences of past attempts to measure SI reviewed here and touched upon in the previous two papers on SI include: (1) the need for the measurement construct to be situated firmly and clearly in a theory of SI, (2) the test design to be multi-method in format, and (3) the scales should reflect and measure the multidimensional nature of SI (that is, it should reflect both cognitive/ability and behavioral/affective components). Furthermore, the designs should ideally include a consideration of how SI can be linked to individual performance in an organizational or team setting as well as leadership effectiveness, two concerns of the Human Dimension’s interest in SI. Importantly, the proposed definition of SI (page 4) accounts for the multidimensionality of SI; the choice of SI measurement instrument will dictate the other two concerns. These are some of the key elements to consider as we review contemporary SI measurement tools that the Army may be interested in using or learning from.\n\nTromsø Social Intelligence Scale (TSIS)\n\nSilvera, Martinussen, and Dahl developed the Tromsø Social Intelligence Scale (TSIS) based on their study of experts’ implicit understanding of SI.¹²⁸ As part of their initial validation study, the authors interviewed 14 psychology faculty to establish the following working definition of social intelligence: “the ability to understand other people and how they will react to different social situations.”¹²⁹ This definition served as the basis of their measurement construct, and is also very similar to the multidimensional definition of SI we propose the Army adopt (page 4 above).\n\nThe goal of the TSIS is to present a SI measurement design that accounts for the multi-dimensional nature of SI. Reflected in the definition above, the authors acknowledge the cognitive (“...ability to understand other people...”) and the behavioral (“...how they will react...”) dimensions of social intelligence in the TSIS. It is important to note, however, that corresponding to the expert input they collected on implicit definitions of SI that"

A second crucial element of the mechanism’s design is that it is short and easy to administer. Silvera et al argue that despite the wide interest in SI few commercially available measurement instruments have been developed, and of those many are time-consuming and unwieldy to administer.¹³⁰\n\nThe TSIS is a self-report test that consists of three subscales of SI: (1) social information processing, (2) social skills, and (3) social awareness. These subscales were identified using Exploratory Factor Analysis to examine the results of a preliminary 103-item version of the TSIS tested among 202 university students. The social skills component measures social performance (the behavioral component of SI), while the social information processing and social awareness components measure social perception (the cognitive component of SI). The TSIS consists of a total of 21 items, with seven items for each of the three subscales.¹³¹ Respondents are asked to rank themselves along a seven-point Likert scale for each item, ranging from “1” (“describes me extremely poorly”) to “7” (“describes me extremely well”). The test should take most respondents no more than five minutes to complete. Each of the 21 items in the TSIS are presented in Figure 6 below."

      "text": "In their initial test, the authors found the scale to be reliable. As predicted, the results indicated that SI might rely more on cognitive skills than behavioral skills. Though the English version of the TSIS has not been rigorously tested, independent research that has evaluated the tool in other languages have confirmed its high reliability.¹³³ Although it is a self-report study, the authors argue that the format of the TSIS is not susceptible to faking due to a measure of social desirability response bias that they included in the validation process.¹³⁴ Meijs later confirmed this in another study.¹³⁵ In summary, Bartone states that the TSIS \"appears to be an excellent candidate for assessing social judgment in a... straightforward manner.\"¹³⁶\n\nThe TSIS is appealing for its brevity and easy administration. Although it hasn’t been widely validated, studies that are available for it are promising. While the test is publically available the Army would need to empirically validate the TSIS’s utility for the unique purposes that the Army is interested in, which would require modest initial resources. Finally, the TSIS has been developed and validated for several languages, some of which are key military partners for the US Army (including Romania, Turkey, Italy, and Norway). As such, the TSIS may prove useful in facilitating multinational cooperation as well as selecting and placing Army personnel on multinational teams.¹³⁷\n\nDespite these potential benefits, the TSIS may be of questionable utility to the Army for a number of reasons. First, the test is relatively new. While results are thus far positive, independent scholars have not subjected the test (particularly its English version) to rigorous analysis and validation. The relative absence of scientific and independent validation may preclude the Army’s investment in the TSIS. Importantly, the TSIS has not"

Second, the test relies on a single method (self-report). Although the potential shortcomings of the self-report format (susceptibility to faking and social desirability bias) are supposedly accounted for in the original design, it may be cause for concern in future validation studies. Third, the definition that the TSIS relies upon may be a \"rather specific view\" of SI.¹³⁸ This view may align with some of the intended populations or applications of SI in the Army, but likely not all. Fourth, and related to the previous point, the TSIS, though based on a similar multidimensional definition of SI that we recommend the Army adopt, has not been developed explicitly to measure individual SI as it relates to a team environment or for leadership, two of the key concerns of the Army's interest in SI. In fact, the original study that validated the TSIS was based on a relatively small sample (n=202) of Norwegian college students. The indicators of high SI among this sample may be considerably different than that among US Army personnel. These concerns don't mean that the TSIS will not accurately predict relevant SI among US Army personnel; only that it would better serve the US Army to conduct additional empirical research to more rigorously prove that the TSIS can predict such performance among its unique personnel to achieve mission success in order to justify the Army's investment in the tool.\n\nA more recent measurement tool is the Magdeburg Test of Social Intelligence (MTSI). A group of German psychologists, several of them from the University of Magdeburg, published the results of two initial validation studies on the test in 2013. The authors argued that the majority of SI measurement constructs demonstrated low convergent validity with other measures of SI and could rarely be adequately distinguished from academic intelligence (discriminant validity).¹³⁹ They also believed that—contrary to the authors of the TSIS—these limitations were due to reliance on verbal stimuli of artificial, unrealistic material in a self-report format. Furthermore, they cited recent MTMM study designs of SI that provided compelling evidence of the multidimensional nature of the SI construct as an important guide to developing future SI measurement tools. These concerns provided some of the key motivation for the authors to develop the MTSI.\n\nThe MTSI is based on a performance model of SI that is supported by strong data from a previous study.¹⁴⁰ The performance model is a multidimensional conceptualization of SI; however, it includes in its framework cognitive abilities only and not any behavioral components (such as personality traits and motivation). The logic is that cognitive abilities greatly influence behavior and are sufficient enough to validly predict performance across a generalized range of social situations. Behavioral components\n\n¹³⁸ Lara Delić, Petra Novak, Jan Kovačič, and Andreja Avsec, \"Self-reported Emotional and Social Intelligence and Empathy as Distinctive Predictors of Narcissism,\" Psychological Topics 20, No. 3 (2011): 481.\n\n¹³⁹ Conzelmann et al., \"New Findings About Social Intelligence,\" 119.\n\n¹⁴⁰ Weis and Süß, \"Reviving the Search for Social Intelligence,\" 5."

The relationship between the cognitive domains and the behavioral domain of the performance model is illustrated in Figure 7. This may ultimately be a limitation of the study, but the authors argue that measuring cognitive-social abilities are sufficient to effectively assess a broad conceptualization of SI in addition to simplifying the test as much as possible.\n\nThe performance model of SI that the MTSI is based upon consists of five domains: (1) social understanding, (2) social memory, (3) social perception, (4) social flexibility, and (5) social knowledge. The authors postponed development of the social flexibility and social knowledge components due to the \"enormity\" of the task that operationalizing them would require, however, the MTSI only measures the first three dimensions of the performance model: social understanding, social memory, and social perception.¹⁴² These are described in Figure 8."

      "text": "The MTSI consists of performance tests for each of these domains. The subtests present realistic and mostly nonverbal material using a variety of multimedia. One review of the MTSI described its format:\n\nThe stimuli were selected on the basis of a taxonomy of social situations... and culled from actual [video] footage of volunteers [the test-takers] who were recorded for long periods of time. After viewing the stimuli [including emails, letters, phone-call recordings, photos, and videos] that experts (academic psychologists) selected as test items the [test-takers] answered detailed questions about the social and emotional content of those materials, which were used as the basis for scoring. That is, the [MTSI] is an ecologically valid^144 assessment of social intelligence based on target scoring.^145,146\n\nThis method is in stark contrast to the contextually abstract self-report formats of many other measures of SI, including the TSIS. The intent is to present test subjects with socially relevant stimuli embedded in realistic social contexts, two critical concerns for validly measuring social abilities. The initial version of the MTSI consisted of 16 tasks, several of which are described in Figure 9 as examples. Due to the personalized and detailed nature of the test design, the MTSI is extremely time-consuming to administer. One sample of the initial validation study took approximately 10 hours to complete over the course of two days, while another sample took 11 hours over two days."

Examples of tasks on the MTSI and their descriptions.¹⁴⁷\n\nThe realistic, personalized, and contextualized nature of the MTSI is very appealing. So, too, is its intent to measure a broad ability conceptualization of SI instead of a more specific measure that includes behavioral components which have been difficult to prove empirically in SI. For these same reasons, however, the MTSI might be problematic for the Army’s use. The formidably detailed format of the tool may be cost prohibitive to effectively develop and administer to a wide swath of Army personnel (although it may be more appealing to use as a targeted program among smaller, specialized organizations like those found within USASOC). Furthermore, because it is broad it may provide a helpful generalized account of individual social ability (which might be useful to administer to recruits, for instance, if it were not so cost and time prohibitive) but provide little in the way of accurate precision for specific team or leader tasks. That the measure is very new is an additional concern. And while the initial publication on the MTSI was empirically and theoretically rigorous and provided positive evidence of its validity, these results have not yet been subjected to any serious, peer-reviewed, and independent verification. Also, the samples of the first two validation studies of the MTSI consisted of German university students and not professionals. However, in time this test appears to be extremely thorough, based on a specific and comprehensive model of SI that is multidimensional and makes use of a wide range of socially- and personally-relevant situations through multimedia (the MTSI takes advantage of a number of test formats, including situation judgment tests, assessment centers, and performance-based tests). It is worth keeping an eye on future validation\n\n¹⁴⁷ Conzelmann et al., \"New Findings About Social Intelligence,\" 121-122.\n\n24"

Theirs is a “background data measure of SI” (abbreviated here as BDMSI) that was commissioned to support the US Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (USAJFKSWCS) and was published as a technical report for the United States Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI).¹⁴⁸ Background data measures are also called life history measures and are generally administered in self-report formats, as the BDMSI is.¹⁴⁹ While the results of the test are preliminary, the BDMSI is notable in that it was designed explicitly to account for individual performance on team tasks in the US Army.¹⁵⁰\n\nThe BDMSI is rooted in definitions of SI that focus on behavioral effectiveness of individuals in social contexts.¹⁵¹ Zaccaro et al specifically cite the conceptualizations of SI offered by Ford and Tisak¹⁵² and Marlowe,¹⁵³ the latter of which is suggested in this paper as the one that the Army should adopt as a working definition.¹⁵⁴ A key feature of the BDMSI is its intent to measure “both social perceptiveness and flexible behavior in accordance with situation requirements.”¹⁵⁵ The BDMSI is therefore based on a multidimensional approach to SI that situates respondents in socially relevant and meaningful scenarios.¹⁵⁶ The study grew out of interest to develop a measurement tool to aid the USAJFKSWCS to “attract, select, and train the highest quality soldiers for Special Forces”.¹⁵⁷ In this regard, the intent of the BDMSI, albeit for a more specific population, very much reflects the Human Dimension community’s interest in SI and the purpose of this paper: namely, leveraging SI to improve how the Army recruits, selects, promotes, and develops its personnel to more effectively achieve mission success. Additionally, the BDMSI was meant to address what the authors considered the “weak and ineffective” measures of SI that were then available.¹⁵⁸"

The authors chose this procedure due to the strong evidence of such methodologies to be “predictive of future behavior patterns.”¹⁵⁹ Background data items require respondents to rate themselves on a variety of “developmentally-relevant events” from throughout their life experiences.¹⁶⁰ In the BDMSI, respondents are asked to rate themselves on 5-point scales appropriate for each item. Background data measures account for typical individual performance (as opposed to accounting for maximal, or potential, performance, which are better measured with cognitive ability mechanisms such as the MTSI).¹⁶¹ So, while multidimensional, the BDMSI emphasizes behavioral components rather than cognitive components of SI. The background data approach is a unique form of a self-report assessment tool. The authors argue that this approach to measuring SI reflects indices of a broad range of “dispositional properties and individual difference characteristics such as personality, cognitive capacities, affective qualities, and motivational variables.”¹⁶²\n\nThe 41 items of the BDMSI were generated to reflect three domains (or subscales) of SI: (1) social perceptiveness (which includes the subcomponents interpersonal perception and systems perception), (2) behavioral flexibility, and (3) social competence. The subscales are described in Figure 10 while a few of the 41 items of the BDMSI are presented in Figure 11 as examples. The domains are based on the conceptualization of SI developed by Zaccaro et al. Importantly, this conceptualization explicitly links SI to leader effectiveness (a key concern of the Army’s interest in the construct). Furthermore, their conceptualization was guided by Marlowe’s definition of SI that has been discussed previously. Zaccaro et al’s understanding of SI, like Marlowe’s, is multidimensional. The items in the BDMSI were proposed and selected by a panel who were each expert in background data measures and also familiar with contemporary SI literature."

Zaccaro et al’s study shows that SI, as measured by the BDMSI, accounted for “unique variance in leader status” (along with measures of metacognition and openness to experience);¹⁷⁷ however, SI did not predict any variance of team performance. To break it down further: systems perception (a component of the social perceptiveness domain of the BDMSI explained above) and behavioral flexibility both “contributed significantly to the prediction of [military] rank and career achievement” among the Army personnel study population.¹⁷⁸ Notably, interpersonal perception, the other component of social perceptiveness, had no correlation to rank and achievement in the validation study.¹⁷⁹ A review of the study concluded by stating that the results of the BDMSI support the importance of social capacities for organizational leadership.¹⁸⁰\n\nThe BDMSI appears to be a particularly promising measure of SI for the Army within the Human Dimension. Most importantly, it is multidimensional and has been developed explicitly to account for individual performance and leadership in an Army setting. The representation of a “systems perception” component and its clear linkage in the BDMSI to SI and individual effectiveness may be of particular interest to the Army. Unlike other measures of SI, which tend to measure SI in either personally-important contexts or no context at all, the BDMSI takes into account the importance of awareness not only of individuals but also of the larger organization in which the social interaction is taking place (in this case, within the Army). The BDMSI’s focus on systems perception correlates well to linking SI to Army mission success by keeping the specific goals of the Army a top priority when considering how to interact with other individuals and teams, and assess the effectiveness of that interaction in terms of institutional success.\n\nThe shortcomings of the BDMSI, however, are also clear. Most notably, the test was developed in 1995 and has, as far as we can tell, been left idle over the intervening two decades. There have been no additional independent validation studies of the BDMSI nor has the measure been updated or amended (for instance, it may be worthwhile to integrate more nonverbal components that make use of recent technological advances"

On the positive side, however, the BDMSI was developed for the Army by ARI, so there are likely no obstructing proprietary issues with adopting it or amending it in the future for use in the Army. At the very least, it may be worth the Army revisiting the BDMSI to commission some additional independent validation of the original results to explore if it might be used again for a wider audience and the specific interests of the Army Human Dimension community. Finally, there are the usual concerns with the BDMSI that are present for other nascent measures of SI: the format is exclusively self-report and the initial validation study consisted of a small sample size. As mentioned above, these concerns could be addressed relatively quickly with future validation studies of the original tool.\n\n## Measurement Summary\n\nThorndike’s observation nearly a century ago that “convenient tests of social intelligence are hard to devise” remains largely true today.¹⁸¹ By some estimates IQ tests continue to be the best predictors of workplace performance.¹⁸² Scholars, however, continue to develop measures of SI to address what IQ cannot with the intent of better assessing social abilities that may influence professional performance and outcomes. These assessment tools build upon the lessons of preceding attempts, becoming increasingly sophisticated and, in some ways, more accurate as methodologies and analysis develop over time. As we have reviewed, there is a range of approaches to SI measurement that make use of a variety of historical and emerging methodologies (self-report, situational judgment tests, peer-/other-report). In turn, each of these methods measures a variety of components of SI (cognitive, behavioral, and multidimensional as well as implicit and personality perspectives of SI that were not addressed here). As we have explored, each of these approaches has benefits and none are without challenges. Figure 12 details the key components of the measurement tools we have reviewed.\n\n¹⁸¹ Edward L.

Despite the broad interest in SI there have been relatively few rigorous attempts to develop SI—both now and throughout its history.

This speaks to the difficulty (or the futility, as some might argue) of the endeavor.\n\nThe three contemporary examples reviewed above are not exhaustive. Instead, they represent some of the most promising contemporary efforts to measure SI that might be of particular interest to the Army and its interest in developing \"trusted Army Professionals as effective team members who thrive in complex social environments, adapt to diverse cultures, communicate effectively, and build relationships.\"¹⁸⁴ The discussion also provides a survey of the diversity of approaches that have been developed."

      "text": "Other contemporary measures of SI present similar methodologies, with corresponding advantages and challenges. For instance, the Interpersonal Perception Task-15 (IPT-15) is a multimedia test of social perception, intended to measure an individual’s ability to decode nonverbal cues to determine the mental states (emotions, intentions, etc.) of others.¹⁸⁵ The IPT-15 is a cognitive ability test that presents 15 video scenes of different social settings and then asks respondents a number of relevant questions (“Who is the child of the two adults?”) in order to assess a person’s social sensitivity.¹⁸⁶ Alternatively, Schneider and Johnson’s Social Knowledge Test (SKT) is a 6-scale, video-based, behavioral test of SI.¹⁸⁷ Importantly, the measure was developed to specifically measure individual social performance in the Army and the initial results, like the BDMSI, were published as an ARI report.¹⁸⁸ The limitations of these tests are similar to some of the examples described in more detail above: namely, small sample sizes and limited or absent independent analysis and validation.\n\nOther mechanisms cited in the literature don’t attempt to measure SI explicitly, but rather sub-components of it or constructs that are similar but not explicitly conceptualized as SI (such as “social skills,” “social competence,” and “social functioning”). For instance, Riggio’s Social Skills Inventory (SSI) incorporates social and emotional components to form a broader measure of social functioning than what many conceptualizations of SI consist of.¹⁸⁹ Importantly, the SSI is embedded in leadership research and intended for an organizational/workplace setting. While not assessing SI explicitly, such an approach may still serve the Army’s ultimate goal of better assessing personnel, including Soldiers, leaders, and civilians.\n\nFinally, some scholars have sought to identify specific components of existing IQ measures to account for SI. For instance, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale—Revised (WAIS-R) is an established measure of traditional human intelligence (dating back to 1944).¹⁹⁰ It contains “Comprehension” and “Picture Arrangement” subtests that include some items that have explicit social relevance or a social component. As a result, some have tried isolating these subtests of the WAIS-R and linking them to SI. Results have been mixed, but more recent observations have not been favorable.¹⁹¹,¹⁹²,¹⁹³ For what it"

For the present concerns of the Human Dimension, however, we believe the BDMSI to be the most appropriate tool to consider. Most importantly, the BDMSI is designed specifically to measure US Army Soldier and leader performance in the unique working environment of the Army. Furthermore, the measure is relatively short and easy to administer, relies on a multidimensional conceptualization of SI, and is already owned by the Army (and therefore would require no copyright or proprietary investment). For these reasons, the BDMSI appears to be the most logical starting point among the available tools to explore SI measurement in and for the Army in order to optimize the performance of its personnel to, as the US Army Operating Concept states, \"improve critical thinking, increase cognitive… performance, foster intuition and social empathy… facilitate talent management, enhance leader training, and strengthen unit cohesion.\"¹⁹⁵\n\nSince it was first proposed nearly a century ago, a number of approaches have been used in attempts to define SI. This genesis resulted in an extensive and varied catalogue of academic and practical products that describe SI through a list of cognitive and behavioral components. Some of these are highlighted in Figure X. Combined with an absence of any coherent theory of SI, the competing component lists of SI serve to undermine its validity and progress towards properly distinguishing it from academic intelligence."

      "text": "Naturally, people’s aptitude with either of these dimensions differ, which partially accounts for individuals’ differing effectiveness in social interactions.\n\nThe role of SI in organizational outcomes on leader effectiveness and job performance is of obvious interest to the Army for a number of reasons. Most importantly, an effective and valid approach to SI specifically tailored to unique Army mission sets may provide it with a capability to more effectively identify, assess, develop, and promote its personnel. This naturally coincides with the Army’s current Human Dimension effort. More broadly, SI provides a powerful framework for understanding human behavior in social contexts (though of course it is not without its limitations, as were noted in the HDCDTF white paper, Social Intelligence: Introduction and Overview for the Army’s Human Dimension Initiative²¹⁰). This is reflected in Army research, which has often addressed the role of SI in the Army explicitly,²¹¹ and doctrine, which has incorporated many of the principles of SI more implicitly.²¹² The Army’s interest in linking SI to individual performance, leadership, and team outcomes guides how it ought to consider the utility and suitability of SI development programs.\n\nDue to the theoretical, conceptual, and operational shortcomings of SI discussed throughout this series, it comes as no surprise therefore that there is a paucity of empirical research on methods that are explicitly designed to improve or develop SI. A seemingly obvious obstacle to identifying or developing effective programs that do so is establishing if such programs are successful. That is, if we don’t have an independently validated and agreed upon method to effectively measure SI (which in turn is at least partially due to a lack of any agreed upon definition of SI) how can we accurately determine if training or education programs to develop SI in individuals are successful? While there is continued interest and there have been notable developments and progress in the subject, SI conceptualization and measurement are very real shortcomings—as we have reviewed ad nauseam throughout these white papers. This presents a fundamental problem in productively identifying SI development programs that the Army should keep in mind.\n\nThe most logical approach to developing SI is to address specific components of it to improve rather than attempting to improve SI as a whole. The multidimensional approach to SI facilitates this by breaking the concept down into distinct components that can more readily be addressed through training and education. For instance, many multidimensional conceptualizations of SI separate cognitive abilities from behavioral effectiveness (which are in turn each made up of distinct sub-components). This is reflected in Marlowe’s multidimensional definition of SI that we propose the Army adopt:\n\n²¹⁰ Human Dimension Capabilities Development Task Force, Social Intelligence: Introduction and Overview for the Army’s Human Dimension Initiative (Fort Leavenworth, KS: Mission Command Center of Excellence, September 2015).\n²¹¹ Ibid., 33-36.\n²¹² Ibid., 31-33."

The more cognitive components, however, are learned later in life and therefore may be subject to change or improvement through training, education, and experience. It seems appropriate, then, that cognitive components should be the focus of SI training modules.\n\nSuch an approach would require the Army to identify an existing model of SI or develop its own based on the lessons of the literature. Ideally, any model of SI employed by the US Army would enumerate the cognitive abilities of SI that are particularly critical for individual and team success in the Army. In some ways the Army has already identified various interpersonal and intrapersonal skills it considers essential for its personnel, many of which are similar or related to components of SI. Rather than couched in an explicit model of SI, however, the Army has identified these characteristics and skills elsewhere, most notably in the ADRP 6-22²¹⁵,²¹⁶ One approach to improving SI in the Army therefore is to adopt or design training and education that targets these distinct components, which may in turn develop SI in Army personnel. Many of the sub-components of SI can also be considered elements of basic social skills, which Riggio argues are “learned communication abilities” and it is thereby “reasonable to expect that people can develop and enhance them.”²¹⁷\n\nThe Army’s University of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies (UFMCS) curriculum already addresses many of the elements that make up conceptualizations of SI. Their Applied Critical Thinking Handbook (formerly known as the Red Teaming Handbook) outlines four major area that the UFMCS focuses on within their curriculum: (1) self-awareness and reflection, (2) groupthink mitigation and decision support, (3) critical thinking, and (4) fostering cultural empathy. These are briefly described in Figure 14."

      "text": "All of these UFMCS curriculum components have direct links to SI. Self-awareness and reflection are explicit and major dimensions of many models of SI. Self-awareness can be considered part of the social perception domain of SI that allows individuals to better understand their role in specific social situations and then reflect on what actions might best serve their or their team’s interests. Groupthink mitigation and decision support are both linked to the systems perception component of SI that the BDMSI suggested was so important to individual SI in organizational contexts. While self-awareness, empathy, and reflection may help an individual perceive the emotions and intent of themselves and others, it is critical thinking of available courses of action and reaction that will guide them to appropriate behavior. Finally, fostering cultural empathy in some ways is more specific than the other components; however, it is also critical to SI. Of course, SI is necessary for cross-cultural interactions, but it is also necessary for social interaction of any kind. In this regard, the empathy portion of UFMCS’s focus on cultural empathy is critical. Empathy allows individuals to better assess the mental states of others in social situations and appreciate how your behavior may influence that mental state, which in turn affects the outcome of interaction.\n\nThough not explicitly addressing SI, the UFMCS focuses on many of the same concerns of what SI consists of. Considering the dearth of rigorous empirical research on SI programs, it may serve the Army’s interest in SI if it were to use the targeted curriculum that the UFMCS has developed and apply it more broadly to its personnel in order to develop their SI.\n\nAn additional consideration of developing interpersonal and intrapersonal skill that are critical to SI is that they are better learned through what some consider nontraditional methods of teaching.

ELT supposes that experience forms the foundation for four modes of learning, which comprise a cycle: 1) feeling, 2) reflecting, 3) thinking, and 4) acting. With that, ELT proposes that knowledge is best learned in a context in which it is meaningful and in which it can be applied so that the learner can immediately and directly see the correlation between new knowledge and other critical information that they already possess.²²¹\n\nSimilarly, some scholars point to the difference between an incremental theory of human behavior and an entity theory of human behavior.²²²,²²³ Incremental theories argue that variations in an individual’s behavior is a result of their awareness of the unique requirements of that particular situation. Here, they assess the norms or necessities of that situation and act accordingly to the best of their ability (this is very similar to multidimensional conceptualizations of SI that include social perceptiveness and behavioral effectiveness). On the other hand, entity theories assume that people act consistently across situations, regardless of their requirements. In the realm of SI, one would assume a person with high SI would adhere to the incremental theory of behavior while a person with lower SI may endorse the entity theory. Another theory-based approach to improving SI, therefore, would be to encourage individuals through training and education to migrate their thinking from an entity theory of behavior to an incremental theory of behavior.\n\nThe “soft skills” that make up so much of SI often require a higher order of learning and understanding before they can be implemented, which is fundamentally different from rote learning of more basic tasks or skills.

The review presented here illustrates a substantial and evolving body of literature on the subject that can help guide the Army. While an important takeaway is the lack of any pre-existing, all-in-one programs for measuring or developing SI, a number of key lessons emerge that can benefit the Army's Human Dimension initiative as it continues to investigate and develop efforts to address its interest in SI and prepare for the complex and changing OE of the future. The discussion presented here on approaches to measure and improve SI can be summarized in four key points.\n\nFirst, the design of SI measures often dictates their utility for a given population or purpose. In this sense, the context of the test questions (socially-specific vs. socially-general, for example) matter greatly, as does its linkage to specific job tasks and organizational outcomes. A test intended for a specific Army leadership cohort looks much different than one intended for all new Army recruits. For instance, the BDMSI was developed for the US Army Special Forces, with specific tasks and outcomes related to their mission and purpose that might be influenced by SI in mind. On the other hand, the TSIS and MTSI were both developed for more general purposes. Each approach to measuring to SI is valuable, but each serves a different purpose.\n\nSecond, SI assessments should reflect the multidimensional nature of SI. Most scholars now agree that SI is a multidimensional construct that consists of cognitive and behavioral components. Adopting or acknowledging a multidimensional definition of SI, which we propose, can partially address this concern. Ideally, a test of SI would consist of multiple subtests to be able to accurately measure both components and thereby create a composite SI factor. As the literature reveals, however, this is a complex endeavor and has so far proved difficult. If a multidimensional measure of SI is impracticable, any test the Army considers ought to be couched in a multidimensional conceptualization or theoretical framework of SI and expressly state which component(s) of SI it is addressing.\n\nThird, the format of the SI measurement test is important. Each format has strengths and weaknesses that need to be acknowledged and accounted for in the test design. MTMM designs that incorporate multiple formats to offset potential variance caused by any single format have emerged as promising and scientifically rigorous measures of SI. Furthermore, nonverbal measures are believed to be especially critical to assessing SI so that the construct is not conflated with traditional measures of IQ that rely largely on written questions and answers. A promising development in this regard is the increased"

Without any meaningful measure of SI, development tools or education programs intended to improve SI will remain problematic. However, the multidimensional approach to SI may facilitate developing components of SI where attempts to develop SI as a whole prove challenging. In this case, the most logical approach to training or developing SI is to target specific interpersonal and intrapersonal skills that are suggested as elements of SI and also considered critical to individual and team success for the Army. These might be social awareness, self-awareness, organizational/systems awareness, and empathy, for instance. Many of these are established concepts in the literature outside of SI and have attendant development and training programs. The Army’s own UFMCS is addressing many of these components in their curriculum that may serve the Army’s interest to improve it among their personnel more broadly.\n\nWith these observations in mind, as well as the literature reviewed here and in the previous two white papers on SI, the HDCDTF provides the following recommendations to the Army:\n\nThe ability to understand the feelings, thoughts, and behaviors of persons, including oneself, in interpersonal situations and to act appropriately upon that understanding.²²⁴"
